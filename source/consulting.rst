FFmpeg-related consulting and employment opportunities
================================================================

If you're running a business that uses FFmpeg or would like to use FFmpeg, you will sometimes want to have an expert,
i.e. one of the original developers, work with you to figure out an issue, fix a bug or add some new feature.

This page is a list of those FFmpeg developers that are available for employment or consulting.
The FFmpeg project highly recommends these people to be hired by your business.
All developers on this list maintain some code in FFmpeg, which serves as a testimony for their competence.
By hiring one of these developers, your business can also (indirectly) support the development of FFmpeg.

If you do not know whom to hire in particular or if none of the listed areas of expertise fits your requirements,
you can send an email to the ffmpeg-devel mailing list, where it will reach a wider audience.
