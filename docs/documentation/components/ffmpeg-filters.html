<h2>2 Filtering Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#filtering-introduction" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.</p>
<p>In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the following filtergraph.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nb">input</span> <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="n">split</span> <span class="o">---------------------&gt;</span> <span class="n">overlay</span> <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="n">output</span>
            <span class="o">|</span>                             <span class="o">^</span>
            <span class="o">|</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">tmp</span><span class="p">]</span>                  <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">flip</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">|</span>
            <span class="o">+-----&gt;</span> <span class="n">crop</span> <span class="o">--&gt;</span> <span class="n">vflip</span> <span class="o">-------+</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the following command to achieve this:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf “split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2” OUTPUT
The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored onto the bottom half of the output video.</p>
<p>Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example, crop,vflip are in one linear chain, split and overlay are separately in another. The points where the linear chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to the labels [main] and [tmp].</p>
<p>The stream sent to the second output of split, labelled as [tmp], is processed through the crop filter, which crops away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The overlay filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the split filter (which was labelled as [main]), and overlay on its lower half the output generated by the crop,vflip filterchain.</p>
<p>Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other by a colon.</p>
<p>There exist so-called source filters that do not have an audio/video input, and sink filters that will not have audio/video output.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graph2dot">
<h2>3 graph2dot<a class="headerlink" href="#graph2dot" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>The graph2dot program included in the FFmpeg tools directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a corresponding textual representation in the dot language.</p>
<p>Invoke the command:</p>
<p>graph2dot -h
to see how to use graph2dot.</p>
<p>You can then pass the dot description to the dot program (from the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation of the filtergraph.</p>
<p>For example the sequence of commands:</p>
<p>echo GRAPH_DESCRIPTION | tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp &amp;&amp; dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png &amp;&amp; display graph.png
can be used to create and display an image representing the graph described by the GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string. Note that this string must be a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined. For example if your command line is of the form:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile
your GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string will need to be of the form:</p>
<p>nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink
you may also need to set the nullsrc parameters and add a format filter in order to simulate a specific input file.</p>

<div class="section" id="filtergraph-description">
<h2>4 Filtergraph description<a class="headerlink" href="#filtergraph-description" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.</p>
<p>Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class registered in the application, which defines the features and the number of input and output pads of the filter.</p>
<p>A filter with no input pads is called a “source”, and a filter with no output pads is called a “sink”.</p>
<p>4.1 Filtergraph syntax
A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the -filter/-vf/-af and -filter_complex options in ffmpeg and -vf/-af in ffplay, and by the avfilter_graph_parse_ptr() function defined in libavfilter/avfilter.h.</p>
<p>A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is represented by a list of “,”-separated filter descriptions.</p>
<p>A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of filterchains is represented by a list of “;”-separated filterchain descriptions.</p>
<p>A filter is represented by a string of the form: [in_link_1]…[in_link_N]filter_name&#64;id=arguments[out_link_1]…[out_link_M]</p>
<p>filter_name is the name of the filter class of which the described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of the filter classes registered in the program optionally followed by “&#64;id”. The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string “=arguments”.</p>
<p>arguments is a string which contains the parameters used to initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:</p>
<p>A ’:’-separated list of key=value pairs.
A ’:’-separated list of value. In this case, the keys are assumed to be the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the fade filter declares three options in this order – type, start_frame and nb_frames. Then the parameter list in:0:30 means that the value in is assigned to the option type, 0 to start_frame and 30 to nb_frames.
A ’:’-separated list of mixed direct value and long key=value pairs. The direct value must precede the key=value pairs, and follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following key=value pairs can be set in any preferred order.
If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the format filter takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by ‘|’.</p>
<p>The list of arguments can be quoted using the character ‘’’ as initial and ending mark, and the character ‘’ for escaping the characters within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set ‘[]=;,’) is encountered.</p>
<p>The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and followed by a list of link labels. A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output or input pad. The preceding labels in_link_1 … in_link_N, are associated to the filter input pads, the following labels out_link_1 … out_link_M, are associated to the output pads.</p>
<p>When two link labels with the same name are found in the filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is created.</p>
<p>If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain. For example in the filterchain</p>
<p>nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink
the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled “L1”, the first input pad of overlay is labelled “L2”, and the second output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay, which are both unlabelled.</p>
<p>In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not specified, “in” is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not specified, “out” is assumed.</p>
<p>In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.</p>
<p>Libavfilter will automatically insert scale filters where format conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending sws_flags=flags; to the filtergraph description.</p>
<p>Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:</p>
<p>NAME             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and ‘_’
FILTER_NAME      ::= NAME[“&#64;”NAME]
LINKLABEL        ::= “[” NAME “]”
LINKLABELS       ::= LINKLABEL [LINKLABELS]
FILTER_ARGUMENTS ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
FILTER           ::= [LINKLABELS] FILTER_NAME [“=” FILTER_ARGUMENTS] [LINKLABELS]
FILTERCHAIN      ::= FILTER [,FILTERCHAIN]
FILTERGRAPH      ::= [sws_flags=flags;] FILTERCHAIN [;FILTERGRAPH]
4.2 Notes on filtergraph escaping
Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of escaping. See (ffmpeg-utils)the “Quoting and escaping” section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for more information about the employed escaping procedure.</p>
<p>A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option value, which may contain the special character : used to separate values, or one of the escaping characters ‘.</p>
<p>A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which may contain the escaping characters ‘ or the special characters [],; used by the filtergraph description.</p>
<p>Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special characters contained within it.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following string to be embedded in the drawtext filter description text value:</p>
<p>this is a ‘string’: may contain one, or more, special characters
This string contains the ‘ special escaping character, and the : special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:</p>
<p>text=this is a ‘string’: may contain one, or more, special characters
A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:</p>
<p>drawtext=text=this is a 'string'\: may contain one, or more, special characters
(note that in addition to the ‘ escaping special characters, also , needs to be escaped).</p>
<p>Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that is special and needs to be escaped with another , the previous string will finally result in:</p>
<p>-vf “drawtext=text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters”
5 Timeline editing
Some filters support a generic enable option. For the filters supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non-zero, the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the next filter in the filtergraph.</p>
<p>The expression accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘t’
timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown</p>
<p>‘n’
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0</p>
<p>‘pos’
the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown</p>
<p>‘w’
‘h’
width and height of the input frame if video</p>
<p>Additionally, these filters support an enable command that can be used to re-define the expression.</p>
<p>Like any other filtering option, the enable option follows the same rules.</p>
<p>For example, to enable a blur filter (smartblur) from 10 seconds to 3 minutes, and a curves filter starting at 3 seconds:</p>
<p>smartblur = enable=’between(t,10,3*60)’,
curves    = enable=’gte(t,3)’ : preset=cross_process
See ffmpeg -filters to view which filters have timeline support.</p>

<h2>6 Options for filters with several inputs (framesync)<a class="headerlink" href="#options-for-filters-with-several-inputs-framesync" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some filters with several inputs support a common set of options. These options can only be set by name, not with the short notation.</p>
<p>eof_action
The action to take when EOF is encountered on the secondary input; it accepts one of the following values:</p>
<p>repeat
Repeat the last frame (the default).</p>
<p>endall
End both streams.</p>
<p>pass
Pass the main input through.</p>
<p>shortest
If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>repeatlast
If set to 1, force the filter to extend the last frame of secondary streams until the end of the primary stream. A value of 0 disables this behavior. Default value is 1.</p>

<div class="section" id="audio-filters">
<h2>7 Audio Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#audio-filters" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the existing filters using –disable-filters. The configure output will show the audio filters included in your build.</p>
<p>Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.</p>
<p>7.1 acompressor
A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal. Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to improve the overall loudness. It’s done to get the highest attention of a listener, “fatten” the sound and bring more “power” to the track. If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or “dead” afterwards or it may start to “pump” (which could be a powerful effect but can also destroy a track completely). The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.</p>
<p>Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level threshold and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio of 2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over the time. This is done by setting “Attack” and “Release”. attack determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched. The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the makeup setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the knee flattens the hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_in
Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.</p>
<p>mode
Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.</p>
<p>threshold
If a signal of stream rises above this level it will affect the gain reduction. By default it is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.</p>
<p>ratio
Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level rose 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>attack
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.</p>
<p>release
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.</p>
<p>makeup
Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.</p>
<p>knee
Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.</p>
<p>link
Choose if the average level between all channels of input stream or the louder(maximum) channel of input stream affects the reduction. Default is average.</p>
<p>detection
Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mostly smoother.</p>
<p>mix
How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>7.2 acontrast
Simple audio dynamic range compression/expansion filter.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>contrast
Set contrast. Default is 33. Allowed range is between 0 and 100.</p>
<p>7.3 acopy
Copy the input audio source unchanged to the output. This is mainly useful for testing purposes.</p>
<p>7.4 acrossfade
Apply cross fade from one input audio stream to another input audio stream. The cross fade is applied for specified duration near the end of first stream.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>nb_samples, ns
Specify the number of samples for which the cross fade effect has to last. At the end of the cross fade effect the first input audio will be completely silent. Default is 44100.</p>
<p>duration, d
Specify the duration of the cross fade effect. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. By default the duration is determined by nb_samples. If set this option is used instead of nb_samples.</p>
<p>overlap, o
Should first stream end overlap with second stream start. Default is enabled.</p>
<p>curve1
Set curve for cross fade transition for first stream.</p>
<p>curve2
Set curve for cross fade transition for second stream.</p>
<p>For description of available curve types see afade filter description.</p>
<p>7.4.1 Examples
Cross fade from one input to another:
ffmpeg -i first.flac -i second.flac -filter_complex acrossfade=d=10:c1=exp:c2=exp output.flac
Cross fade from one input to another but without overlapping:
ffmpeg -i first.flac -i second.flac -filter_complex acrossfade=d=10:o=0:c1=exp:c2=exp output.flac
7.5 acrossover
Split audio stream into several bands.</p>
<p>This filter splits audio stream into two or more frequency ranges. Summing all streams back will give flat output.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>split
Set split frequencies. Those must be positive and increasing.</p>
<p>order
Set filter order, can be 2nd, 4th or 8th. Default is 4th.</p>
<p>7.6 acrusher
Reduce audio bit resolution.</p>
<p>This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled with. This doesn’t change the bit depth at all, it just produces the effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and “digital”. This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete bit depths. Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of the lower and the upper half of the signal. An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce “softer” crushing sounds.</p>
<p>Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode. This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones. The result is a much more “natural” sounding crusher which doesn’t gate low signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception, so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant. Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_in
Set level in.</p>
<p>level_out
Set level out.</p>
<p>bits
Set bit reduction.</p>
<p>mix
Set mixing amount.</p>
<p>mode

<p>Samples detected as impulsive noise are replaced by interpolated samples using autoregressive modelling.</p>
<p>w
Set window size, in milliseconds. Allowed range is from 10 to 100. Default value is 55 milliseconds. This sets size of window which will be processed at once.</p>
<p>o
Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from 50 to 95. Default value is 75 percent. Setting this to a very high value increases impulsive noise removal but makes whole process much slower.</p>
<p>a
Set autoregression order, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from 0 to 25. Default value is 2 percent. This option also controls quality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.</p>
<p>t
Set threshold value. Allowed range is from 1 to 100. Default value is 2. This controls the strength of impulsive noise which is going to be removed. The lower value, the more samples will be detected as impulsive noise.</p>
<p>b
Set burst fusion, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is 0 to 10. Default value is 2. If any two samples detected as noise are spaced less than this value then any sample between those two samples will be also detected as noise.</p>
<p>m

<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>a
Select overlap-add method. Even not interpolated samples are slightly changed with this method.</p>
<p>s

<p>7.9 adeclip
Remove clipped samples from input audio.</p>
<p>Samples detected as clipped are replaced by interpolated samples using autoregressive modelling.</p>
<p>w
Set window size, in milliseconds. Allowed range is from 10 to 100. Default value is 55 milliseconds. This sets size of window which will be processed at once.</p>
<p>o
Set window overlap, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from 50 to 95. Default value is 75 percent.</p>
<p>a
Set autoregression order, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is from 0 to 25. Default value is 8 percent. This option also controls quality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.</p>
<p>t
Set threshold value. Allowed range is from 1 to 100. Default value is 10. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.</p>
<p>n
Set size of histogram used to detect clips. Allowed range is from 100 to 9999. Default value is 1000. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.</p>
<p>m
Set overlap method.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>a
Select overlap-add method. Even not interpolated samples are slightly changed with this method.</p>
<p>s
Select overlap-save method. Not interpolated samples remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Default value is a.</p>

<p>Samples in delayed channel are filled with silence.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following option:</p>
<p>delays

If number of given delays is smaller than number of channels all remaining channels will not be delayed. If you want to delay exact number of samples, append ’S’ to number. If you want instead to delay in seconds, append ’s’ to number.</p>
<p>7.10.1 Examples
Delay first channel by 1.5 seconds, the third channel by 0.5 seconds and leave the second channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.
adelay=1500|0|500
Delay second channel by 500 samples, the third channel by 700 samples and leave the first channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.
adelay=0|500S|700S
7.11 aderivative, aintegral
Compute derivative/integral of audio stream.</p>
<p>Applying both filters one after another produces original audio.</p>
<p>7.12 aecho
Apply echoing to the input audio.</p>
<p>Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains (and sometimes large buildings) when talking or shouting; digital echo effects emulate this behaviour and are often used to help fill out the sound of a single instrument or vocal. The time difference between the original signal and the reflection is the delay, and the loudness of the reflected signal is the decay. Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.</p>
<p>A description of the accepted parameters follows.</p>
<p>in_gain
Set input gain of reflected signal. Default is 0.6.</p>
<p>out_gain
Set output gain of reflected signal. Default is 0.3.</p>
<p>delays

<p>7.12.1 Examples
Make it sound as if there are twice as many instruments as are actually playing:
aecho=0.8:0.88:60:0.4
If delay is very short, then it sound like a (metallic) robot playing music:
aecho=0.8:0.88:6:0.4
A longer delay will sound like an open air concert in the mountains:
aecho=0.8:0.9:1000:0.3
Same as above but with one more mountain:
aecho=0.8:0.9:1000|1800:0.3|0.25
7.13 aemphasis
Audio emphasis filter creates or restores material directly taken from LPs or emphased CDs with different filter curves. E.g. to store music on vinyl the signal has to be altered by a filter first to even out the disadvantages of this recording medium. Once the material is played back the inverse filter has to be applied to restore the distortion of the frequency response.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_in

Set the ’|’-separated expressions list for each separate channel. If the number of input channels is greater than the number of expressions, the last specified expression is used for the remaining output channels.</p>
<p>channel_layout, c
Set output channel layout. If not specified, the channel layout is specified by the number of expressions. If set to ‘same’, it will use by default the same input channel layout.</p>
<p>Each expression in exprs can contain the following constants and functions:</p>

channel number of the current expression</p>
<p>n
number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0</p>

7.20 agate
A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.</p>
<p>Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level threshold and dividing it by the factor set with ratio. The bottom of the noise floor is set via range. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over time. This is done by setting attack and release.</p>
<p>attack determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold before any reduction will occur and release sets the time the signal has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.</p>
<p>level_in
Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.</p>

<p>range
Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.</p>
<p>threshold
If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>ratio
Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.</p>
<p>attack
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.</p>
<p>release
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.</p>
<p>makeup
Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.</p>
<p>knee
Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.</p>
<p>detection
Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.</p>
<p>link
Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.</p>

<p>Coefficients in tf format are separated by spaces and are in ascending order.</p>
<p>Coefficients in zp format are separated by spaces and order of coefficients doesn’t matter. Coefficients in zp format are complex numbers with i imaginary unit.</p>
<p>Different coefficients and gains can be provided for every channel, in such case use ’|’ to separate coefficients or gains. Last provided coefficients will be used for all remaining channels.</p>

<p>asc
When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of releasing to an average reduction level rather than reaching a reduction of 0 in the release time.</p>
<p>asc_level
Select how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0 means nearly no changes in release time while 1 produces higher release times.</p>
<p>level

This filter supports the following commands:</p>
<p>frequency, f
Change allpass frequency. Syntax for the command is : “frequency”</p>
<p>width_type, t
Change allpass width_type. Syntax for the command is : “width_type”</p>
<p>width, w
Change allpass width. Syntax for the command is : “width”</p>
<p>7.24 aloop
Loop audio samples.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>loop
Set the number of loops. Setting this value to -1 will result in infinite loops. Default is 0.</p>
<p>size
Set maximal number of samples. Default is 0.</p>
<p>start
Set first sample of loop. Default is 0.</p>
<p>7.25 amerge
Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>inputs
Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.</p>
<p>If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible, the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of channels.</p>
<p>For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.</p>
<p>All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.</p>
<p>If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the shortest.</p>
<p>7.25.1 Examples
Merge two mono files into a stereo stream:
amovie=left.wav [l] ; amovie=right.mp3 [r] ; [l] [r] amerge
Multiple merges assuming 1 video stream and 6 audio streams in input.mkv:
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex “[0:1][0:2][0:3][0:4][0:5][0:6] amerge=inputs=6” -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv
7.26 amix
Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.</p>
<p>Note that this filter only supports float samples (the amerge and pan audio filters support many formats). If the amix input has integer samples then aresample will be automatically inserted to perform the conversion to float samples.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT
will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same duration as the first input and a dropout transition time of 3 seconds.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>inputs
The number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.</p>
<p>duration
How to determine the end-of-stream.</p>
<p>longest
The duration of the longest input. (default)</p>
<p>shortest
The duration of the shortest input.</p>
<p>first
The duration of the first input.</p>
<p>dropout_transition
The transition time, in seconds, for volume renormalization when an input stream ends. The default value is 2 seconds.</p>
<p>weights
Specify weight of each input audio stream as sequence. Each weight is separated by space. By default all inputs have same weight.</p>
<p>7.27 amultiply
Multiply first audio stream with second audio stream and store result in output audio stream. Multiplication is done by multiplying each sample from first stream with sample at same position from second stream.</p>
<p>With this element-wise multiplication one can create amplitude fades and amplitude modulations.</p>
<p>7.28 anequalizer
High-order parametric multiband equalizer for each channel.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>params
This option string is in format: “cchn f=cf w=w g=g t=f | …” Each equalizer band is separated by ’|’.</p>
<p>chn
Set channel number to which equalization will be applied. If input doesn’t have that channel the entry is ignored.</p>
<p>f

<p>w
Set band width in hertz.</p>
<p>g

<p>size
Set video stream size. Only useful if curves option is activated.</p>
<p>mgain
Set max gain that will be displayed. Only useful if curves option is activated. Setting this to a reasonable value makes it possible to display gain which is derived from neighbour bands which are too close to each other and thus produce higher gain when both are activated.</p>
<p>fscale
Set frequency scale used to draw frequency response in video output. Can be linear or logarithmic. Default is logarithmic.</p>
<p>colors
Set color for each channel curve which is going to be displayed in video stream. This is list of color names separated by space or by ’|’. Unrecognised or missing colors will be replaced by white color.</p>
<p>7.28.1 Examples

anequalizer=c0 f=200 w=100 g=-10 t=1|c1 f=200 w=100 g=-10 t=1
7.28.2 Commands
This filter supports the following commands:</p>
<p>change
Alter existing filter parameters. Syntax for the commands is : “fN|f=freq|w=width|g=gain”</p>
<p>fN is existing filter number, starting from 0, if no such filter is available error is returned. freq set new frequency parameter. width set new width parameter in herz. gain set new gain parameter in dB.</p>

<p>packet_size
Set silence packet size. Default value is 4096.</p>
<p>pad_len
Set the number of samples of silence to add to the end. After the value is reached, the stream is terminated. This option is mutually exclusive with whole_len.</p>
<p>whole_len

<p>pad_dur
Specify the duration of samples of silence to add. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-zero value.</p>
<p>whole_dur
Specify the minimum total duration in the output audio stream. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-zero value.

apad=pad_len=1024
Make sure the audio output will contain at least 10000 samples, pad the input with silence if required:
apad=whole_len=10000
Use ffmpeg to pad the audio input with silence, so that the video stream will always result the shortest and will be converted until the end in the output file when using the shortest option:
ffmpeg -i VIDEO -i AUDIO -filter_complex “[1:0]apad” -shortest OUTPUT
7.32 aphaser
Add a phasing effect to the input audio.</p>
<p>A phaser filter creates series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs are modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect.</p>

7.33 apulsator
Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo. But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with different waveforms and shifted phases. This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other. The left and right channel are altered equally - a conventional tremolo. An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) - pulsator acts as an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some “bypassing” sounds with sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_in
Set input gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].</p>
<p>level_out
Set output gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].</p>
<p>mode
Set waveform shape the LFO will use. Can be one of: sine, triangle, square, sawup or sawdown. Default is sine.</p>
<p>amount
Set modulation. Define how much of original signal is affected by the LFO.</p>
<p>offset_l
Set left channel offset. Default is 0. Allowed range is [0 - 1].</p>
<p>offset_r
Set right channel offset. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is [0 - 1].</p>
<p>width
Set pulse width. Default is 1. Allowed range is [0 - 2].</p>
<p>timing
Set possible timing mode. Can be one of: bpm, ms or hz. Default is hz.</p>
<p>bpm
Set bpm. Default is 120. Allowed range is [30 - 300]. Only used if timing is set to bpm.</p>
<p>ms
Set ms. Default is 500. Allowed range is [10 - 2000]. Only used if timing is set to ms.</p>
<p>hz
Set frequency in Hz. Default is 2. Allowed range is [0.01 - 100]. Only used if timing is set to hz.</p>
<p>7.34 aresample
Resample the input audio to the specified parameters, using the libswresample library. If none are specified then the filter will automatically convert between its input and output.</p>
<p>This filter is also able to stretch/squeeze the audio data to make it match the timestamps or to inject silence / cut out audio to make it match the timestamps, do a combination of both or do neither.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the syntax [sample_rate:]resampler_options, where sample_rate expresses a sample rate and resampler_options is a list of key=value pairs, separated by “:”. See the (ffmpeg-resampler)”Resampler Options” section in the ffmpeg-resampler(1) manual for the complete list of supported options.</p>

aresample=44100
Stretch/squeeze samples to the given timestamps, with a maximum of 1000 samples per second compensation:
aresample=async=1000
7.35 areverse
Reverse an audio clip.</p>
<p>Warning: This filter requires memory to buffer the entire clip, so trimming is suggested.</p>
<p>7.35.1 Examples
Take the first 5 seconds of a clip, and reverse it.
atrim=end=5,areverse
7.36 asetnsamples
Set the number of samples per each output audio frame.</p>
<p>The last output packet may contain a different number of samples, as the filter will flush all the remaining samples when the input audio signals its end.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>nb_out_samples, n
Set the number of frames per each output audio frame. The number is intended as the number of samples per each channel. Default value is 1024.</p>
<p>pad, p

<p>7.42 atempo
Adjust audio tempo.</p>
<p>The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must be in the [0.5, 100.0] range.</p>
<p>Note that tempo greater than 2 will skip some samples rather than blend them in. If for any reason this is a concern it is always possible to daisy-chain several instances of atempo to achieve the desired product tempo.</p>
<p>7.42.1 Examples
Slow down audio to 80% tempo:
atempo=0.8
To speed up audio to 300% tempo:
atempo=3
To speed up audio to 300% tempo by daisy-chaining two atempo instances:
atempo=sqrt(3),atempo=sqrt(3)
7.43 atrim
Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>start
Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio sample with the timestamp start will be the first sample in the output.</p>
<p>end
Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be the last sample in the output.</p>
<p>start_pts
Same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples instead of seconds.</p>
<p>end_pts
Same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead of seconds.</p>
<p>duration
The maximum duration of the output in seconds.</p>
<p>start_sample
The number of the first sample that should be output.</p>
<p>end_sample
The number of the first sample that should be dropped.</p>
<p>start, end, and duration are expressed as time duration specifications; see (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.</p>
<p>Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the duration option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the atrim filter.</p>
<p>If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim filters.</p>
<p>The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g. just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Drop everything except the second minute of input:
ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120
Keep only the first 1000 samples:
ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000
7.44 bandpass

<p>7.49 channelmap
Remap input channels to new locations.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>map
Map channels from input to output. The argument is a ’|’-separated list of mappings, each in the in_channel-out_channel or in_channel form. in_channel can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the input channel layout. out_channel is the name of the output channel or its index in the output channel layout. If out_channel is not given then it is implicitly an index, starting with zero and increasing by one for each mapping.</p>
<p>channel_layout
The channel layout of the output stream.</p>
<p>If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels to output channels, preserving indices.</p>
<p>7.49.1 Examples
For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file,
ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter ‘channelmap=map=DL-FL|DR-FR’ out.wav
will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix channels of the input.</p>
<p>To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC’s native channel order
ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter ‘channelmap=1|2|0|5|3|4:5.1’ out.wav
7.50 channelsplit
Split each channel from an input audio stream into a separate output stream.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>channel_layout
The channel layout of the input stream. The default is “stereo”.</p>
<p>channels
A channel layout describing the channels to be extracted as separate output streams or “all” to extract each input channel as a separate stream. The default is “all”.</p>
<p>Choosing channels not present in channel layout in the input will result in an error.</p>
<p>7.50.1 Examples
For example, assuming a stereo input MP3 file,
ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -filter_complex channelsplit out.mkv
will create an output Matroska file with two audio streams, one containing only the left channel and the other the right channel.</p>
<p>Split a 5.1 WAV file into per-channel files:
ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex
‘channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]’
-map ‘[FL]’ front_left.wav -map ‘[FR]’ front_right.wav -map ‘[FC]’
front_center.wav -map ‘[LFE]’ lfe.wav -map ‘[SL]’ side_left.wav -map ‘[SR]’
side_right.wav
Extract only LFE from a 5.1 WAV file:
ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex ‘channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1:channels=LFE[LFE]’
-map ‘[LFE]’ lfe.wav
7.51 chorus
Add a chorus effect to the audio.</p>
<p>Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.</p>
<p>Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay is constant, with chorus, it is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation. The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly off key.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>in_gain
Set input gain. Default is 0.4.</p>
<p>out_gain
Set output gain. Default is 0.4.</p>
<p>delays
Set delays. A typical delay is around 40ms to 60ms.</p>
<p>decays
Set decays.</p>
<p>speeds
Set speeds.</p>
<p>depths
Set depths.</p>
<p>7.51.1 Examples

Two delays:
chorus=0.6:0.9:50|60:0.4|0.32:0.25|0.4:2|1.3

chorus=0.5:0.9:50|60|40:0.4|0.32|0.3:0.25|0.4|0.3:2|2.3|1.3
7.52 compand
Compress or expand the audio’s dynamic range.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>attacks
decays
A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. attacks refers to increase of volume and decays refers to decrease of volume. For most situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds. If specified number of attacks &amp; decays is lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.</p>
<p>points
A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using the following syntax: x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|…. or x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ….</p>
<p>The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function does not have to be monotonically rising. The point 0/0 is assumed but may be overridden (by 0/out-dBn). Typical values for the transfer function are -70/-70|-60/-20|1/0.</p>
<p>soft-knee
Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.</p>
<p>gain
Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>volume
Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>delay
Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>7.52.1 Examples

compand=.3|.3:1|1:-90/-60|-60/-40|-40/-30|-20/-20:6:0:-90:0.2

7.53 compensationdelay
Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing positions of microphones or speakers.</p>
<p>For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in different location. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that distance of ~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone to capture signal in antiphase to another microphone. That makes the final mix sounding moody. This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays to each microphone track and make them synchronized.</p>
<p>The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and synchronize other tracks one by one with it. Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too. Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>mm
Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance for fine tuning. Default is 0.</p>
<p>cm
Set cm distance. This is compensation distance for tightening distance setup. Default is 0.</p>
<p>m
Set meters distance. This is compensation distance for hard distance setup. Default is 0.</p>
<p>dry
Set dry amount. Amount of unprocessed (dry) signal. Default is 0.</p>
<p>wet
Set wet amount. Amount of processed (wet) signal. Default is 1.</p>
<p>temp
Set temperature degree in Celsius. This is the temperature of the environment. Default is 20.</p>
<p>7.54 crossfeed
Apply headphone crossfeed filter.</p>
<p>Crossfeed is the process of blending the left and right channels of stereo audio recording. It is mainly used to reduce extreme stereo separation of low frequencies.</p>
<p>The intent is to produce more speaker like sound to the listener.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>strength
Set strength of crossfeed. Default is 0.2. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. This sets gain of low shelf filter for side part of stereo image. Default is -6dB. Max allowed is -30db when strength is set to 1.</p>
<p>range
Set soundstage wideness. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. This sets cut off frequency of low shelf filter. Default is cut off near 1550 Hz. With range set to 1 cut off frequency is set to 2100 Hz.</p>
<p>level_in
Set input gain. Default is 0.9.</p>
<p>level_out
Set output gain. Default is 1.</p>
<p>7.55 crystalizer
Simple algorithm to expand audio dynamic range.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>i
Sets the intensity of effect (default: 2.0). Must be in range between 0.0 (unchanged sound) to 10.0 (maximum effect).</p>
<p>c
Enable clipping. By default is enabled.</p>
<p>7.56 dcshift
Apply a DC shift to the audio.</p>
<p>This can be useful to remove a DC offset (caused perhaps by a hardware problem in the recording chain) from the audio. The effect of a DC offset is reduced headroom and hence volume. The astats filter can be used to determine if a signal has a DC offset.</p>
<p>shift
Set the DC shift, allowed range is [-1, 1]. It indicates the amount to shift the audio.</p>
<p>limitergain
Optional. It should have a value much less than 1 (e.g. 0.05 or 0.02) and is used to prevent clipping.</p>
<p>7.57 drmeter
Measure audio dynamic range.</p>
<p>DR values of 14 and higher is found in very dynamic material. DR of 8 to 13 is found in transition material. And anything less that 8 have very poor dynamics and is very compressed.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>length
Set window length in seconds used to split audio into segments of equal length. Default is 3 seconds.</p>
<p>7.58 dynaudnorm
Dynamic Audio Normalizer.</p>
<p>This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in contrast to more “simple” normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer <em>dynamically</em> re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio. This allows for applying extra gain to the “quiet” sections of the audio while avoiding distortions or clipping the “loud” sections. In other words: The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will “even out” the volume of quiet and loud sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves this goal <em>without</em> applying “dynamic range compressing”. It will retain 100% of the dynamic range <em>within</em> each section of the audio file.</p>
<p>f
Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds. Default is 500 milliseconds. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks, referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a “standard” normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has been found to give good results with most files. Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.</p>
<p>g
Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd number. Default is 31. Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the window size of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter’s window size is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31 takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation. In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a “traditional” normalization filter. On the contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.</p>
<p>p
Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude. A frame’s maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*. It is not recommended to go above this value.</p>
<p>m
Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by the frame’s highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer additionally bounds the frame’s maximum gain factor by a predetermined (global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain factors in “silent” or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a “hard” threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold). Instead, a “sigmoid” threshold function will be applied. This way, the gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that value.</p>
<p>r
Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs “peak” normalization. This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined (only) by the frame’s highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer can also take into account the frame’s root mean square, abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered that the RMS is a better approximation of the “perceived loudness” than just looking at the signal’s peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform “perceived loudness” can be established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame’s local gain factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value. Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the frame’s highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.</p>
<p>n
Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e. the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the “loudest” channel. However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be “quieter” than the other one(s). In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way, the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending only on the individual channel’s highest magnitude sample. This allows for harmonizing the volume of the different channels.</p>
<p>c
Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled. An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values. In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the -1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the audio signal, or “waveform”, should be centered around the zero point. That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from 0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction. With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine the mean value, or “DC correction” offset, of each input frame and subtract that value from all of the frame’s sample values which ensures those samples are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid “gaps” at the frame boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly between neighbouring frames.</p>
<p>b
Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the subsequent frames. However, for the “boundary” frames, located at the very beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames in the “boundary” region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth “fade in” and “fade out” at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.</p>
<p>s
Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0. By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply “traditional” compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However, in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer’s normalization algorithm with a more “traditional” compression. For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression (thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled, all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual frame. In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa. Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.</p>

<p>If the specified value is not valid, it is ignored and prior one is kept.</p>
<p>7.70 loudnorm
EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and linear normalization modes. Support for both single pass (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes. This algorithm can target IL, LRA, and maximum true peak. To accurately detect true peaks, the audio stream will be upsampled to 192 kHz unless the normalization mode is linear.

7.73 mcompand
Multiband Compress or expand the audio’s dynamic range.</p>
<p>The input audio is divided into bands using 4th order Linkwitz-Riley IIRs. This is akin to the crossover of a loudspeaker, and results in flat frequency response when absent compander action.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>args
This option syntax is: attack,decay,[attack,decay..] soft-knee points crossover_frequency [delay [initial_volume [gain]]] | attack,decay … For explanation of each item refer to compand filter documentation.</p>
<p>7.74 pan
Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.</p>
<p>This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the channels of an audio stream.</p>
<p>The filter accepts parameters of the form: “l|outdef|outdef|…”</p>
<p>l
output channel layout or number of channels</p>
<p>outdef
output channel specification, of the form: “out_name=[gain*]in_name[(+-)[gain*]in_name…]”</p>
<p>out_name
output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel number (c0, c1, etc.)</p>
<p>gain
multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged</p>
<p>in_name
input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to mix named and numbered input channels</p>
<p>If the ‘=’ in a channel specification is replaced by ‘&lt;’, then the gains for that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus avoiding clipping noise.</p>
<p>7.74.1 Mixing examples
For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a bigger factor for the left channel:</p>
<p>pan=1c|c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1
A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5- and 7-channels surround:</p>
<p>pan=stereo| FL &lt; FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL | FR &lt; FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR
Note that ffmpeg integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system that should be preferred (see “-ac” option) unless you have very specific needs.</p>
<p>7.74.2 Remapping examples
The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:</p>
<p>gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,
only one input per channel output,
If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user (“Pure channel mapping detected”), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the remapping.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by dropping the extra channels:</p>
<p>pan=”stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR”
Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels and keep the input channel layout:</p>
<p>pan=”5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5”
If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and still keep the stereo channel layout) with:</p>
<p>pan=”stereo|c1=c1”
Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both front left and right:</p>
<p>pan=”stereo| c0=FR | c1=FR”
7.75 replaygain
ReplayGain scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as an input and outputs it unchanged. At end of filtering it displays track_gain and track_peak.</p>
<p>7.76 resample
Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. It is not meant to be used directly.</p>
<p>7.77 rubberband
Apply time-stretching and pitch-shifting with librubberband.</p>

7.78 sidechaincompress
This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to compress detected signal using second input signal. It needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal. The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters in later stages of processing. See pan and amerge filter.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_in
Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.</p>
<p>mode
Set mode of compressor operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward.</p>
<p>threshold
If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will affect the gain reduction of first stream. By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.</p>
<p>ratio
Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level raised 4dB above the threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction. Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>attack
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction starts. Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.</p>
<p>release
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.</p>
<p>makeup
Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing. Default is 1. Range is from 1 to 64.</p>
<p>knee
Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.82843. Range is between 1 and 8.</p>
<p>link
Choose if the average level between all channels of side-chain stream or the louder(maximum) channel of side-chain stream affects the reduction. Default is average.</p>
<p>detection
Should the exact signal be taken in case of peak or an RMS one in case of rms. Default is rms which is mainly smoother.</p>
<p>level_sc
Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.</p>
<p>mix
How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1. Range is between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>7.78.1 Examples
Full ffmpeg example taking 2 audio inputs, 1st input to be compressed depending on the signal of 2nd input and later compressed signal to be merged with 2nd input:
ffmpeg -i main.flac -i sidechain.flac -filter_complex “[1:a]asplit=2[sc][mix];[0:a][sc]sidechaincompress[compr];[compr][mix]amerge”
7.79 sidechaingate
A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage. Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the threshold. For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a natural drum or remove “rumbling” of muted strokes from a heavily distorted guitar. It needs two input streams and returns one output stream. First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_in
Set input level before filtering. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.</p>
<p>mode
Set the mode of operation. Can be upward or downward. Default is downward. If set to upward mode, higher parts of signal will be amplified, expanding dynamic range in upward direction. Otherwise, in case of downward lower parts of signal will be reduced.</p>
<p>range
Set the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold. Default is 0.06125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.</p>
<p>threshold
If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released. Default is 0.125. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>ratio
Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.</p>
<p>attack
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops. Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.</p>
<p>release
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction is increased again. Default is 250 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.</p>
<p>makeup
Set amount of amplification of signal after processing. Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.</p>
<p>knee
Curve the sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly. Default is 2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.</p>
<p>detection
Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one. Default is rms. Can be peak or rms.</p>
<p>link
Choose if the average level between all channels or the louder channel affects the reduction. Default is average. Can be average or maximum.</p>
<p>level_sc
Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.</p>
<p>7.80 silencedetect
Detect silence in an audio stream.</p>
<p>This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the minimum detected noise duration.</p>
<p>The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>noise, n

ffmpeg -i silence.mp3 -af silencedetect=noise=0.0001 -f null -
7.81 silenceremove
Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>start_periods
This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio the start_periods will be 1 but it can be increased to higher values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>start_duration
Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated as silence and trimmed off. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>start_threshold
This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital audio, a value of 0 may be fine but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise. Can be specified in dB (in case “dB” is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>start_silence
Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.</p>
<p>start_mode
Specify mode of detection of silence end in start of multi-channel audio. Can be any or all. Default is any. With any, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence. With all, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence.</p>
<p>stop_periods
Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a stop_periods that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by start_periods, making it suitable for removing periods of silence in the middle of the audio. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>stop_duration
Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the audio. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>stop_threshold
This is the same as start_threshold but for trimming silence from the end of audio. Can be specified in dB (in case “dB” is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>stop_silence
Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.</p>
<p>stop_mode
Specify mode of detection of silence start in end of multi-channel audio. Can be any or all. Default is any. With any, any sample that is detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence. With all, only if all channels are detected as non-silence will cause stopped trimming of silence.</p>
<p>detection
Set how is silence detected. Can be rms or peak. Second is faster and works better with digital silence which is exactly 0. Default value is rms.</p>
<p>window
Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number of samples for detecting silence. Default value is 0.02. Allowed range is from 0 to 10.</p>
<p>7.81.1 Examples
The following example shows how this filter can be used to start a recording that does not contain the delay at the start which usually occurs between pressing the record button and the start of the performance:
silenceremove=start_periods=1:start_duration=5:start_threshold=0.02
Trim all silence encountered from beginning to end where there is more than 1 second of silence in audio:
silenceremove=stop_periods=-1:stop_duration=1:stop_threshold=-90dB
7.82 sofalizer
SOFAlizer uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create virtual loudspeakers around the user for binaural listening via headphones (audio formats up to 9 channels supported). The HRTFs are stored in SOFA files (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sofacoustics.org/">http://www.sofacoustics.org/</a> for a database). SOFAlizer is developed at the Acoustics Research Institute (ARI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.</p>

volume=volume=1/2
volume=volume=-6.0206dB
In all the above example the named key for volume can be omitted, for example like in:</p>
<p>volume=0.5
Increase input audio power by 6 decibels using fixed-point precision:
volume=volume=6dB:precision=fixed
Fade volume after time 10 with an annihilation period of 5 seconds:
volume=’if(lt(t,10),1,max(1-(t-10)/5,0))’:eval=frame
7.91 volumedetect
Detect the volume of the input video.</p>
<p>The filter has no parameters. The input is not modified. Statistics about the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.</p>
<p>In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of a histogram of the registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of the samples).</p>
<p>All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.</p>
<p>7.91.1 Examples
Here is an excerpt of the output:</p>
<p>[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409
It means that:</p>
<p>The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.
The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.
There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.
In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping, raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.</p>
<p>8 Audio Sources
Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.</p>
<p>8.1 abuffer
Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.</p>
<p>This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular through the interface defined in libavfilter/asrc_abuffer.h.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>time_base
The timebase which will be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It must be either a floating-point number or in numerator/denominator form.</p>
<p>sample_rate
The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.</p>
<p>sample_fmt
The sample format of the incoming audio buffers. Either a sample format name or its corresponding integer representation from the enum AVSampleFormat in libavutil/samplefmt.h</p>
<p>channel_layout
The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers. Either a channel layout name from channel_layout_map in libavutil/channel_layout.c or its corresponding integer representation from the AV_CH_LAYOUT_* macros in libavutil/channel_layout.h</p>
<p>channels
The number of channels of the incoming audio buffers. If both channels and channel_layout are specified, then they must be consistent.</p>
<p>8.1.1 Examples
abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=s16p:channel_layout=stereo
will instruct the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at 44100Hz. Since the sample format with name “s16p” corresponds to the number 6 and the “stereo” channel layout corresponds to the value 0x3, this is equivalent to:</p>
<p>abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=6:channel_layout=0x3
8.2 aevalsrc
Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.</p>
<p>This source accepts in input one or more expressions (one for each channel), which are evaluated and used to generate a corresponding audio signal.</p>
<p>This source accepts the following options:</p>
<p>exprs
Set the ’|’-separated expressions list for each separate channel. In case the channel_layout option is not specified, the selected channel layout depends on the number of provided expressions. Otherwise the last specified expression is applied to the remaining output channels.</p>
<p>channel_layout, c
Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the specified layout must be equal to the number of specified expressions.</p>
<p>duration, d
Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified duration, as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.</p>
<p>If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is supposed to be generated forever.</p>
<p>nb_samples, n
Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default to 1024.</p>
<p>sample_rate, s
Specify the sample rate, default to 44100.</p>
<p>Each expression in exprs can contain the following constants:</p>
<p>n
number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0</p>
<p>t
time of the evaluated sample expressed in seconds, starting from 0</p>
<p>s
sample rate</p>

9 Audio Sinks
Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.</p>
<p>9.1 abuffersink
Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.</p>
<p>This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular through the interface defined in libavfilter/buffersink.h or the options system.</p>
<p>It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which defines the incoming buffers’ formats, to be passed as the opaque parameter to avfilter_init_filter for initialization.</p>
<p>9.2 anullsink
Null audio sink; do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging tools.</p>
<p>10 Video Filters
When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the existing filters using –disable-filters. The configure output will show the video filters included in your build.</p>
<p>Below is a description of the currently available video filters.</p>
<p>10.1 alphaextract
Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This is especially useful with the alphamerge filter.</p>
<p>10.2 alphamerge
Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with alphaextract to allow the transmission or storage of frame sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn’t support an alpha channel.</p>
<p>For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video and a separate video created with alphaextract, you might use:</p>
<p>movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]
Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding pipeline drops frames. If you’re trying to apply an image as an overlay to a video stream, consider the overlay filter instead.</p>
<p>10.3 amplify

Set factor to amplify difference. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>threshold
Set threshold for difference amplification. Any difference greater or equal to this value will not alter source pixel. Default is 10. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>tolerance
Set tolerance for difference amplification. Any difference lower to this value will not alter source pixel. Default is 0. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>low
Set lower limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535. This option controls maximum possible value that will decrease source pixel value.</p>
<p>high
Set high limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535. This option controls maximum possible value that will increase source pixel value.</p>
<p>planes
Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.</p>

<p>In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>black_min_duration, d
Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must be a non-negative floating point number.</p>

<p>10.29 copy
Copy the input video source unchanged to the output. This is mainly useful for testing purposes.</p>
<p>10.30 coreimage
Video filtering on GPU using Apple’s CoreImage API on OSX.</p>
<p>Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is processed by video hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on the respective OSX.</p>
<p>There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along with its options.</p>
<p>The coreimage filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>list_filters
List all available filters and generators along with all their respective options as well as possible minimum and maximum values along with the default values.</p>
<p>list_filters=true
filter
Specify all filters by their respective name and options. Use list_filters to determine all valid filter names and options. Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped to their respective value range. Vector and color options have to be specified by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done. A special option name default is available to use default options for a filter.</p>
<p>It is required to specify either default or at least one of the filter options. All omitted options are used with their default values. The syntax of the filter string is as follows:</p>
<p>filter=&lt;NAME&gt;&#64;&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;[&#64;&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;][&#64;…][#&lt;NAME&gt;&#64;&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;[&#64;&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;][&#64;…]][#…]
output_rect
Specify a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the input image. It is given by a list of space separated float values:</p>
<p>output_rect=xywidthheight
If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image. The output rectangle is automatically cropped at the borders of the input image. Negative values are valid for each component.</p>
<p>output_rect=2525100100
Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains. Currently, only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet usable as intended.</p>
<p>Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the filter output has the same size as the input image.</p>
<p>For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is blended onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the output image.</p>
<p>The coreimagesrc video source can be used for generating input images which are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input images by another video source or an input video is not required.</p>
<p>10.30.1 Examples
List all filters available:
coreimage=list_filters=true
Use the CIBoxBlur filter with default options to blur an image:
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur&#37;&#52;&#48;default">coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur<span>&#64;</span>default</a>
Use a filter chain with CISepiaTone at default values and CIVignetteEffect with its center at 100x100 and a radius of 50 pixels:
coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur&#64;default#CIVignetteEffect&#64;inputCenter=100<a class="reference external" href="mailto:100&#37;&#52;&#48;inputRadius=50">100<span>&#64;</span>inputRadius=50</a>
Use nullsrc and CIQRCodeGenerator to create a QR code for the FFmpeg homepage, given as complete and escaped command-line for Apple’s standard bash shell:
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i nullsrc=s=100x100,coreimage=filter=CIQRCodeGenerator&#64;inputMessage=https\:<a class="reference external" href="mailto://FFmpeg&#46;org/&#37;&#52;&#48;inputCorrectionLevel=H">//FFmpeg<span>&#46;</span>org/<span>&#64;</span>inputCorrectionLevel=H</a> -frames:v 1 QRCode.png
10.31 crop
Crop the input video to given dimensions.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>w, out_w
The width of the output video. It defaults to iw. This expression is evaluated only once during the filter configuration, or when the ‘w’ or ‘out_w’ command is sent.</p>
<p>h, out_h
The height of the output video. It defaults to ih. This expression is evaluated only once during the filter configuration, or when the ‘h’ or ‘out_h’ command is sent.</p>
<p>x
The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left edge of the output video. It defaults to (in_w-out_w)/2. This expression is evaluated per-frame.</p>
<p>y
The vertical position, in the input video, of the top edge of the output video. It defaults to (in_h-out_h)/2. This expression is evaluated per-frame.</p>
<p>keep_aspect
If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio to be the same of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>exact
Enable exact cropping. If enabled, subsampled videos will be cropped at exact width/height/x/y as specified and will not be rounded to nearest smaller value. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>The out_w, out_h, x, y parameters are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>x
y
The computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for each new frame.</p>
<p>in_w
in_h
The input width and height.</p>
<p>iw
ih
These are the same as in_w and in_h.</p>
<p>out_w
out_h
The output (cropped) width and height.</p>
<p>ow
oh
These are the same as out_w and out_h.</p>
<p>a
same as iw / ih</p>
<p>sar
input sample aspect ratio</p>
<p>dar
input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar</p>
<p>hsub
vsub
horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>n
The number of the input frame, starting from 0.</p>
<p>pos
the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown</p>
<p>t
The timestamp expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.</p>
<p>The expression for out_w may depend on the value of out_h, and the expression for out_h may depend on out_w, but they cannot depend on x and y, as x and y are evaluated after out_w and out_h.</p>
<p>The x and y parameters specify the expressions for the position of the top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They are evaluated for each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it is approximated to the nearest valid value.</p>
<p>The expression for x may depend on y, and the expression for y may depend on x.</p>

crop=in_w:1/PHI*in_w
Apply trembling effect:
crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:(in_w-out_w)/2+((in_w-out_w)/2)*sin(n/10):(in_h-out_h)/2 +((in_h-out_h)/2)*sin(n/7)
Apply erratic camera effect depending on timestamp:
crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:(in_w-out_w)/2+((in_w-out_w)/2)*sin(t*10):(in_h-out_h)/2 +((in_h-out_h)/2)*sin(t*13)”
Set x depending on the value of y:
crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:y:10+10*sin(n/10)
10.31.2 Commands
This filter supports the following commands:</p>
<p>w, out_w
h, out_h
x
y
Set width/height of the output video and the horizontal/vertical position in the input video. The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.</p>
<p>If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.</p>
<p>10.32 cropdetect
Auto-detect the crop size.</p>
<p>It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions correspond to the non-black area of the input video.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>limit
Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to everything (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity value greater to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24. You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending on the bitdepth of the pixel format.</p>
<p>round
The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to 16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when encoding to most video codecs.</p>
<p>reset_count, reset
Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0 indicates ’never reset’, and returns the largest area encountered during playback.</p>
<p>10.33 cue
Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first passes on preroll amount of frames, then it buffers at most buffer amount of frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue it forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its input.</p>
<p>The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.</p>
<p>Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result is good enough for some use cases.</p>
<p>cue
The cue timestamp expressed in a UNIX timestamp in microseconds. Default is 0.</p>
<p>preroll
The duration of content to pass on as preroll expressed in seconds. Default is 0.</p>
<p>buffer
The maximum duration of content to buffer before waiting for the cue expressed in seconds. Default is 0.</p>
<p>10.34 curves
Apply color adjustments using curves.</p>
<p>This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by N key points tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for the output frame.</p>
<p>By default, a component curve is defined by the two points (0;0) and (1;1). This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is “adjusted” to its own value, which means no change to the image.</p>
<p>The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new curve (using a natural cubic spline interpolation) will be define to pass smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their x and y values must be in the [0;1] interval. If the computed curves happened to go outside the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>preset
Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition to the r, g, b parameters; in this case, the later options takes priority on the preset values. Available presets are:</p>
<p>‘none’
‘color_negative’
‘cross_process’
‘darker’
‘increase_contrast’
‘lighter’
‘linear_contrast’
‘medium_contrast’
‘negative’
‘strong_contrast’
‘vintage’
Default is none.</p>
<p>master, m
Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It is sometimes called a “luminance” or “value” mapping. It can be used with r, g, b or all since it acts like a post-processing LUT.</p>
<p>red, r
Set the key points for the red component.</p>
<p>green, g
Set the key points for the green component.</p>
<p>blue, b
Set the key points for the blue component.</p>
<p>all
Set the key points for all components (not including master). Can be used in addition to the other key points component options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this all setting.</p>
<p>psfile
Specify a Photoshop curves file (.acv) to import the settings from.</p>
<p>plot
Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.</p>
<p>To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be defined using the following syntax: x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ….</p>
<p>10.34.1 Examples
Increase slightly the middle level of blue:
curves=blue=‘0/0 0.5/0.58 1/1’
Vintage effect:
curves=r=‘0/0.11 .42/.51 1/0.95’:g=‘0/0 0.50/0.48 1/1’:b=‘0/0.22 .49/.44 1/0.8’
Here we obtain the following coordinates for each components:</p>
<p>red
(0;0.11) (0.42;0.51) (1;0.95)</p>
<p>green
(0;0) (0.50;0.48) (1;1)</p>
<p>blue
(0;0.22) (0.49;0.44) (1;0.80)</p>
<p>The previous example can also be achieved with the associated built-in preset:
curves=preset=vintage
Or simply:
curves=vintage
Use a Photoshop preset and redefine the points of the green component:
curves=psfile=’MyCurvesPresets/purple.acv’:green=‘0/0 0.45/0.53 1/1’
Check out the curves of the cross_process profile using ffmpeg and gnuplot:
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color -vf curves=cross_process:plot=/tmp/curves.plt -frames:v 1 -f null -
gnuplot -p /tmp/curves.plt
10.35 datascope

<p>This filter is not designed for real time.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>sigma, s
Set the noise sigma constant.</p>
<p>This sigma defines a hard threshold of 3 * sigma; every DCT coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.</p>
<p>If you need a more advanced filtering, see expr.</p>
<p>Default is 0.</p>
<p>overlap
Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the risk of various artefacts.</p>
<p>If the overlapping value doesn’t permit processing the whole input width or height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won’t be denoised.</p>
<p>Default value is blocksize-1, which is the best possible setting.</p>
<p>expr, e
Set the coefficient factor expression.</p>
<p>For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a multiplier value for the coefficient.</p>
<p>If this is option is set, the sigma option will be ignored.</p>
<p>The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the c variable.</p>
<p>n
Set the blocksize using the number of bits. 1&lt;&lt;n defines the blocksize, which is the width and height of the processed blocks.</p>
<p>The default value is 3 (8x8) and can be raised to 4 for a blocksize of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a better de-noising.</p>
<p>10.36.1 Examples
Apply a denoise with a sigma of 4.5:</p>
<p>dctdnoiz=4.5
The same operation can be achieved using the expression system:</p>
<p>dctdnoiz=e=’gte(c, 4.5*3)’
Violent denoise using a block size of 16x16:</p>
<p>dctdnoiz=15:n=4
10.37 deband

<p>1thr
2thr
3thr
4thr
Set banding detection threshold for each plane. Default is 0.02. Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5. If difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold, it will be considered as banded.</p>
<p>range, r
Banding detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, random number in range 0 to set value will be used. If negative, exact absolute value will be used. The range defines square of four pixels around current pixel.</p>
<p>direction, d
Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive, random direction from 0 to set direction will be picked. If negative, exact of absolute value will be picked. For example direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick only pixels on same column.</p>
<p>blur, b
If enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four surrounding pixels. The default is enabled. If disabled current pixel is compared with all four surrounding pixels. The pixel is considered banded if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.</p>
<p>coupling, c
If enabled, current pixel is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded, e.g. banding detection threshold is triggered for all color components. The default is disabled.</p>
<p>10.38 deblock

<p>filter
Set filter type, can be weak or strong. Default is strong. This controls what kind of deblocking is applied.</p>
<p>block
Set size of block, allowed range is from 4 to 512. Default is 8.</p>
<p>alpha
beta
gamma
delta
Set blocking detection thresholds. Allowed range is 0 to 1. Defaults are: 0.098 for alpha and 0.05 for the rest. Using higher threshold gives more deblocking strength. Setting alpha controls threshold detection at exact edge of block. Remaining options controls threshold detection near the edge. Each one for below/above or left/right. Setting any of those to 0 disables deblocking.</p>
<p>planes

<p>cycle
Set the number of frames from which one will be dropped. Setting this to N means one frame in every batch of N frames will be dropped. Default is 5.</p>
<p>dupthresh
Set the threshold for duplicate detection. If the difference metric for a frame is less than or equal to this value, then it is declared as duplicate. Default is 1.1</p>
<p>scthresh
Set scene change threshold. Default is 15.</p>
<p>blockx
blocky
Set the size of the x and y-axis blocks used during metric calculations. Larger blocks give better noise suppression, but also give worse detection of small movements. Must be a power of two. Default is 32.</p>
<p>ppsrc
Mark main input as a pre-processed input and activate clean source input stream. This allows the input to be pre-processed with various filters to help the metrics calculation while keeping the frame selection lossless. When set to 1, the first stream is for the pre-processed input, and the second stream is the clean source from where the kept frames are chosen. Default is 0.</p>

<p>10.44 dejudder
Remove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined content.</p>
<p>Judder can be introduced, for instance, by pullup filter. If the original source was partially telecined content then the output of pullup,dejudder will have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the container. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame rate video.</p>
<p>The option available in this filter is:</p>
<p>cycle
Specify the length of the window over which the judder repeats.</p>
<p>Accepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:</p>

<p>The rectangle is drawn on the outermost pixels which will be (partly) replaced with interpolated values. The values of the next pixels immediately outside this rectangle in each direction will be used to compute the interpolated pixel values inside the rectangle.</p>
<p>10.45.1 Examples
Set a rectangle covering the area with top left corner coordinates 0,0 and size 100x77, and a band of size 10:
delogo=x=0:y=0:w=100:h=77:band=10

<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>x
y
w
h
Specify a rectangular area where to limit the search for motion vectors. If desired the search for motion vectors can be limited to a rectangular area of the frame defined by its top left corner, width and height. These parameters have the same meaning as the drawbox filter which can be used to visualise the position of the bounding box.</p>
<p>This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects within the frame might be confused for camera motion by the motion vector search.</p>
<p>If any or all of x, y, w and h are set to -1 then the full frame is used. This allows later options to be set without specifying the bounding box for the motion vector search.</p>

10.52 drawbox
Draw a colored box on the input image.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>x
y
The expressions which specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>width, w
height, h
The expressions which specify the width and height of the box; if 0 they are interpreted as the input width and height. It defaults to 0.</p>
<p>color, c
Specify the color of the box to write. For the general syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value invert is used, the box edge color is the same as the video with inverted luma.</p>
<p>thickness, t
The expression which sets the thickness of the box edge. A value of fill will create a filled box. Default value is 3.</p>
<p>See below for the list of accepted constants.</p>
<p>replace
Applicable if the input has alpha. With value 1, the pixels of the painted box will overwrite the video’s color and alpha pixels. Default is 0, which composites the box onto the input, leaving the video’s alpha intact.</p>
<p>The parameters for x, y, w and h and t are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>dar
The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar.</p>
<p>hsub
vsub
horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>in_h, ih

The input width and height.</p>
<p>sar
The input sample aspect ratio.</p>
<p>x
y
The x and y offset coordinates where the box is drawn.</p>
<p>w
h
The width and height of the drawn box.</p>
<p>t
The thickness of the drawn box.</p>
<p>These constants allow the x, y, w, h and t expressions to refer to each other, so you may for example specify y=x/dar or h=w/dar.</p>

10.53 drawgrid
Draw a grid on the input image.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>x
y
The expressions which specify the coordinates of some point of grid intersection (meant to configure offset). Both default to 0.</p>
<p>width, w
height, h
The expressions which specify the width and height of the grid cell, if 0 they are interpreted as the input width and height, respectively, minus thickness, so image gets framed. Default to 0.</p>
<p>color, c
Specify the color of the grid. For the general syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value invert is used, the grid color is the same as the video with inverted luma.</p>
<p>thickness, t
The expression which sets the thickness of the grid line. Default value is 1.</p>
<p>See below for the list of accepted constants.</p>
<p>replace
Applicable if the input has alpha. With 1 the pixels of the painted grid will overwrite the video’s color and alpha pixels. Default is 0, which composites the grid onto the input, leaving the video’s alpha intact.</p>
<p>The parameters for x, y, w and h and t are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>dar
The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar.</p>
<p>hsub
vsub
horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>in_h, ih
in_w, iw
The input grid cell width and height.</p>
<p>sar
The input sample aspect ratio.</p>
<p>x
y
The x and y coordinates of some point of grid intersection (meant to configure offset).</p>
<p>w
h
The width and height of the drawn cell.</p>
<p>t
The thickness of the drawn cell.</p>
<p>These constants allow the x, y, w, h and t expressions to refer to each other, so you may for example specify y=x/dar or h=w/dar.</p>
<p>10.53.1 Examples
Draw a grid with cell 100x100 pixels, thickness 2 pixels, with color red and an opacity of 50%:

<p>x
y
the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.</p>
<p>These parameters allow the x and y expressions to refer each other, so you can for example specify y=x/dar.</p>
<p>10.54.2 Text expansion
If expansion is set to strftime, the filter recognizes strftime() sequences in the provided text and expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of strftime(). This feature is deprecated.</p>
<p>If expansion is set to none, the text is printed verbatim.</p>
<p>If expansion is set to normal (which is the default), the following expansion mechanism is used.</p>
<p>The backslash character ‘’, followed by any character, always expands to the second character.</p>
<p>Sequences of the form %{…} are expanded. The text between the braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ’:’. If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (’:’ or ’}’), they should be escaped.</p>
<p>Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the text option in the filter argument string and as the filter argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell, that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these problems.</p>
<p>The following functions are available:</p>
<p>expr, e
The expression evaluation result.</p>
<p>It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated, which accepts the same constants and functions as the x and y values. Note that not all constants should be used, for example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so the constants text_w and text_h will have an undefined value.</p>
<p>expr_int_format, eif
Evaluate the expression’s value and output as formatted integer.</p>
<p>The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the expr function. The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are ‘x’, ‘X’, ‘d’ and ‘u’. They are treated exactly as in the printf function. The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output. It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.</p>
<p>gmtime
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC. It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.</p>
<p>localtime
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone. It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.</p>
<p>metadata
Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.</p>
<p>The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.</p>
<p>The second argument is optional and specifies a default value, used when the metadata key is not found or empty.</p>
<p>n, frame_num
The frame number, starting from 0.</p>
<p>pict_type
A 1 character description of the current picture type.</p>
<p>pts
The timestamp of the current frame. It can take up to three arguments.</p>
<p>The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to flt for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; hms stands for a formatted [-]HH:MM:SS.mmm timestamp with millisecond accuracy. gmtime stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time; localtime stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as local time zone time.</p>
<p>The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.</p>
<p>If the format is set to hms, a third argument 24HH may be supplied to present the hour part of the formatted timestamp in 24h format (00-23).</p>
<p>If the format is set to localtime or gmtime, a third argument may be supplied: a strftime() format string. By default, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format will be used.</p>
<p>10.54.3 Commands
This filter supports altering parameters via commands:</p>
<p>reinit
Alter existing filter parameters.</p>
<p>Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter invocation, e.g.</p>
<p>fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text=’Hello World’
Full filter invocation with sendcmd would look like this:</p>
<p>sendcmd=c=‘56.0 drawtext reinit fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text=Hello\ World’
If the entire argument can’t be parsed or applied as valid values then the filter will continue with its existing parameters.</p>
<p>10.54.4 Examples
Draw “Test Text” with font FreeSerif, using the default values for the optional parameters.
drawtext=”fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text=’Test Text’”

<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>low
high
Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm.</p>
<p>The high threshold selects the “strong” edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity with the “weak” edge pixels selected by the low threshold.</p>
<p>low and high threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and low should be lesser or equal to high.</p>
<p>Default value for low is 20/255, and default value for high is 50/255.</p>

Choosing planes not available in the input will result in an error. That means you cannot select r, g, b planes with y, u, v planes at same time.</p>
<p>10.58.1 Examples
Extract luma, u and v color channel component from input video frame into 3 grayscale outputs:
ffmpeg -i video.avi -filter_complex ‘extractplanes=y+u+v[y][u][v]’ -map ‘[y]’ y.avi -map ‘[u]’ u.avi -map ‘[v]’ v.avi
10.59 elbg

The number of frames that the fade effect lasts. At the end of the fade-in effect, the output video will have the same intensity as the input video. At the end of the fade-out transition, the output video will be filled with the selected color. Default is 25.</p>
<p>alpha
If set to 1, fade only alpha channel, if one exists on the input. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>start_time, st
Specify the timestamp (in seconds) of the frame to start to apply the fade effect. If both start_frame and start_time are specified, the fade will start at whichever comes last. Default is 0.</p>

At the end of the fade-in effect the output video will have the same intensity as the input video, at the end of the fade-out transition the output video will be filled with the selected color. If both duration and nb_frames are specified, duration is used. Default is 0 (nb_frames is used by default).</p>
<p>color, c
Specify the color of the fade. Default is “black”.</p>
<p>10.61.1 Examples
Fade in the first 30 frames of video:

10.66 fieldmatch
Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine fieldmatch needs to be followed by a decimation filter such as decimate in the filtergraph.</p>
<p>The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two. If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content, fieldmatch will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts. But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be de-interlaced by a later filter such as yadif before decimation.</p>
<p>In addition to the various configuration options, fieldmatch can take an optional second stream, activated through the ppsrc option. If enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless (assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser, or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.</p>
<p>Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project) and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from which fieldmatch is based on. While the semantic and usage are very close, some behaviour and options names can differ.</p>
<p>The decimate filter currently only works for constant frame rate input. If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr stream: dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>order
Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are:</p>
<p>‘auto’
Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg’s internal parity value).</p>
<p>‘bff’
Assume bottom field first.</p>
<p>‘tff’
Assume top field first.</p>
<p>Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the stream.</p>
<p>Default value is auto.</p>
<p>mode
Set the matching mode or strategy to use. pc mode is the safest in the sense that it won’t risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other hand, pcn_ub mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are all somewhere in between pc and pcn_ub in terms of risking jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.</p>
<p>More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in p/c/n/u/b meaning section.</p>
<p>Available values are:</p>
<p>‘pc’
2-way matching (p/c)</p>
<p>‘pc_n’
2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n)</p>
<p>‘pc_u’
2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u)</p>
<p>‘pc_n_ub’
2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if still combed (p/c + n + u/b)</p>
<p>‘pcn’
3-way matching (p/c/n)</p>
<p>‘pcn_ub’
3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are detected as combed (p/c/n + u/b)</p>
<p>The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that mode assuming order=tff (and field on auto or top).</p>
<p>In terms of speed pc mode is by far the fastest and pcn_ub is the slowest.</p>
<p>Default value is pc_n.</p>
<p>ppsrc
Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter introduction for more details. It is similar to the clip2 feature from VFM/TFM.</p>
<p>Default value is 0 (disabled).</p>
<p>field
Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as order unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a large impact on matching performance. Available values are:</p>
<p>‘auto’
Automatic (same value as order).</p>
<p>‘bottom’
Match from the bottom field.</p>
<p>‘top’
Match from the top field.</p>
<p>Default value is auto.</p>
<p>mchroma
Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to 0 only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other artifacts. Setting this to 0 could also be used to speed things up at the cost of some accuracy.</p>
<p>Default value is 1.</p>
<p>y0
y1
These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between y0 and y1 from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may interfere with the matching. y0 sets the starting scan line and y1 sets the ending line; all lines in between y0 and y1 (including y0 and y1) will be ignored. Setting y0 and y1 to the same value will disable the feature. y0 and y1 defaults to 0.</p>
<p>scthresh
Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on the luma plane. Good values are in the [8.0, 14.0] range. Scene change detection is only relevant in case combmatch=sc. The range for scthresh is [0.0, 100.0].</p>
<p>Default value is 12.0.</p>
<p>combmatch
When combatch is not none, fieldmatch will take into account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the final match. Available values are:</p>
<p>‘none’
No final matching based on combed scores.</p>
<p>‘sc’
Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected.</p>
<p>‘full’
Use combed scores all the time.</p>
<p>Default is sc.</p>
<p>combdbg
Force fieldmatch to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and print them. This setting is known as micout in TFM/VFM vocabulary. Available values are:</p>
<p>‘none’
No forced calculation.</p>
<p>‘pcn’
Force p/c/n calculations.</p>
<p>‘pcnub’
Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.</p>
<p>Default value is none.</p>
<p>cthresh
This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This essentially controls how “strong” or “visible” combing must be to be detected. Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from -1 (every pixel will be detected as combed) to 255 (no pixel will be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good range is [8, 12].</p>
<p>Default value is 9.</p>
<p>chroma
Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision. Only disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually, using chroma=0 is usually more reliable, except for the case where there is chroma only combing in the source.</p>
<p>Default value is 0.</p>
<p>blockx
blocky
Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which combpel pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be declared combed. See the combpel parameter description for more info. Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512.</p>
<p>Default value is 16.</p>
<p>combpel
The number of combed pixels inside any of the blocky by blockx size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as combed. While cthresh controls how “visible” the combing must be, this setting controls “how much” combing there must be in any localized area (a window defined by the blockx and blocky settings) on the frame. Minimum value is 0 and maximum is blocky x blockx (at which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known as MI in TFM/VFM vocabulary.</p>
<p>Default value is 80.</p>
<p>10.66.1 p/c/n/u/b meaning
10.66.1.1 p/c/n
We assume the following telecined stream:</p>
<p>Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4
The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.</p>
<p>When fieldmatch is configured to run a matching from bottom (field=bottom) this is how this input stream get transformed:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Input stream:</dt><dd><p>T     1 2 2 3 4
B     1 2 3 4 4   &lt;– matching reference</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Matches:              c c n n c</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Output stream:</dt><dd><p>T     1 2 3 4 4
B     1 2 3 4 4</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated. To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter after this operation. See for instance the decimate filter.</p>
<p>The same operation now matching from top fields (field=top) looks like this:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Input stream:</dt><dd><p>T     1 2 2 3 4   &lt;– matching reference
B     1 2 3 4 4</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Matches:              c c p p c</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Output stream:</dt><dd><p>T     1 2 2 3 4
B     1 2 2 3 4</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In these examples, we can see what p, c and n mean; basically, they refer to the frame and field of the opposite parity:</p>
<p>p matches the field of the opposite parity in the previous frame
c matches the field of the opposite parity in the current frame
n matches the field of the opposite parity in the next frame
10.66.1.2 u/b
The u and b matching are a bit special in the sense that they match from the opposite parity flag. In the following examples, we assume that we are currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2, bottom:2). According to the match, a ’x’ is placed above and below each matched fields.</p>
<p>With bottom matching (field=bottom):</p>
<p>Match:           c         p           n          b          u</p>

<p>10.66.2 Examples
Simple IVTC of a top field first telecined stream:</p>
<p>fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=none, decimate
Advanced IVTC, with fallback on yadif for still combed frames:</p>
<p>fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=full, yadif=deint=interlaced, decimate
10.67 fieldorder
Transform the field order of the input video.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>order
The output field order. Valid values are tff for top field first or bff for bottom field first.</p>
<p>The default value is ‘tff’.</p>
<p>The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content. This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.</p>
<p>If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does not alter the incoming video.</p>
<p>It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material, which is bottom field first.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf “fieldorder=bff” out.dv
10.68 fifo, afifo

<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>fps
The desired output frame rate. The default is 25.</p>
<p>start_time
Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made about the first frame’s expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with duplicates of the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any frames with a negative PTS.</p>
<p>round
Timestamp (PTS) rounding method.</p>
<p>Possible values are:</p>
<p>zero
round towards 0</p>
<p>inf
round away from 0</p>
<p>down
round towards -infinity</p>
<p>up
round towards +infinity</p>
<p>near
round to nearest</p>
<p>The default is near.</p>
<p>eof_action
Action performed when reading the last frame.</p>

<p>pass
Pass through last frame if input duration has not been reached yet.</p>
<p>The default is round.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string: fps[:start_time[:round]].</p>
<p>See also the setpts filter.</p>
<p>10.74.1 Examples

Sets the fps to 24, using abbreviation and rounding method to round to nearest:
fps=fps=film:round=near
10.75 framepack
Pack two different video streams into a stereoscopic video, setting proper metadata on supported codecs. The two views should have the same size and framerate and processing will stop when the shorter video ends. Please note that you may conveniently adjust view properties with the scale and fps filters.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>format
The desired packing format. Supported values are:</p>
<p>sbs
The views are next to each other (default).</p>
<p>tab
The views are on top of each other.</p>
<p>lines
The views are packed by line.</p>
<p>columns
The views are packed by column.</p>
<p>frameseq
The views are temporally interleaved.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p># Convert left and right views into a frame-sequential video
ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex framepack=frameseq OUTPUT</p>
<p># Convert views into a side-by-side video with the same output resolution as the input
ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex [0:v]scale=w=iw/2[left],[1:v]scale=w=iw/2[right],[left][right]framepack=sbs OUTPUT
10.76 framerate
Change the frame rate by interpolating new video output frames from the source frames.</p>
<p>This filter is not designed to function correctly with interlaced media. If you wish to change the frame rate of interlaced media then you are required to deinterlace before this filter and re-interlace after this filter.</p>
<p>A description of the accepted options follows.</p>
<p>fps
Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified as a value alone. The default is 50.</p>
<p>interp_start
Specify the start of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 15.</p>
<p>interp_end
Specify the end of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of two frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 240.</p>
<p>scene
Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as a value between 0 and 100 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one. The default is 8.2.</p>
<p>flags
Specify flags influencing the filter process.</p>
<p>Available value for flags is:</p>
<p>scene_change_detect, scd
Enable scene change detection using the value of the option scene. This flag is enabled by default.</p>
<p>10.77 framestep
Select one frame every N-th frame.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following option:</p>
<p>step
Select frame after every step frames. Allowed values are positive integers higher than 0. Default value is 1.</p>
<p>10.78 freezedetect
Detect frozen video.</p>
<p>This filter logs a message and sets frame metadata when it detects that the input video has no significant change in content during a specified duration. Video freeze detection calculates the mean average absolute difference of all the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.</p>
<p>The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds. The lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start metadata key is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the freeze. The lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration and lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end metadata keys are set on the first frame after the freeze.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>noise, n
Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case “dB” is appended to the specified value) or as a difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.</p>
<p>duration, d
Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).</p>
<p>10.79 frei0r
Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.</p>
<p>To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r header and configure FFmpeg with –enable-frei0r.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>filter_name
The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable FREI0R_PATH is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the directories specified by the colon-separated list in FREI0R_PATH. Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order: HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/, /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/, /usr/lib/frei0r-1/.</p>
<p>filter_params
A ’|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r effect.</p>
<p>A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either “y” or “n”), a double, a color (specified as R/G/B, where R, G, and B are floating point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or a color description as specified in the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual, a position (specified as X/Y, where X and Y are floating point numbers) and/or a string.</p>
<p>The number and types of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an effect parameter is not specified, the default value is set.</p>
<p>10.79.1 Examples
Apply the distort0r effect, setting the first two double parameters:
frei0r=filter_name=distort0r:filter_params=0.5|0.01
Apply the colordistance effect, taking a color as the first parameter:
frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
frei0r=colordistance:violet
frei0r=colordistance:0x112233
Apply the perspective effect, specifying the top left and top right image positions:
frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2|0.8/0.2
For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="http://frei0r.dyne.org">http://frei0r.dyne.org</a></p>
<p>10.80 fspp
Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of spp.</p>
<p>It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post- processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel. This allows for much higher speed.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>quality
Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 4-5. Default value is 4.</p>
<p>qp
Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).</p>
<p>strength
Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values mean more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother but also blurrier. Default value is 0 − PSNR optimal.</p>
<p>use_bframe_qp
Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).</p>
<p>10.81 gblur
Apply Gaussian blur filter.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>sigma
Set horizontal sigma, standard deviation of Gaussian blur. Default is 0.5.</p>
<p>steps
Set number of steps for Gaussian approximation. Default is 1.</p>
<p>planes
Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are filtered.</p>
<p>sigmaV
Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as sigma. Default is -1.</p>
<p>10.82 geq
Apply generic equation to each pixel.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>

<p>green_expr, g
Set the green expression.</p>
<p>blue_expr, b
Set the blue expression.</p>
<p>The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one of the lum_expr, cb_expr, or cr_expr options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr colorspace. If one of the red_expr, green_expr, or blue_expr options is specified, it will select an RGB colorspace.</p>
<p>If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the other one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque value. If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate to the luminance expression.</p>
<p>The expressions can use the following variables and functions:</p>
<p>N
The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.</p>
<p>X
Y
The coordinates of the current sample.</p>
<p>W
H
The width and height of the image.</p>
<p>SW
SH
Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered plane. It is the ratio between the corresponding luma plane number of pixels and the current plane ones. E.g. for YUV4:2:0 the values are 1,1 for the luma plane, and 0.5,0.5 for chroma planes.</p>
<p>T
Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds.</p>
<p>p(x, y)
Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the current plane.</p>
<p>lum(x, y)
Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the luminance plane.</p>
<p>cb(x, y)
Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the blue-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.</p>
<p>cr(x, y)
Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the red-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.</p>
<p>r(x, y)
g(x, y)
b(x, y)
Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the red/green/blue component. Return 0 if there is no such component.</p>
<p>alpha(x, y)
Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the alpha plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.</p>
<p>For functions, if x and y are outside the area, the value will be automatically clipped to the closer edge.</p>
<p>10.82.1 Examples
Flip the image horizontally:
geq=p(W-X,Y)
Generate a bidimensional sine wave, with angle PI/3 and a wavelength of 100 pixels:
geq=128 + 100*sin(2*(PI/100)*(cos(PI/3)*(X-50*T) + sin(PI/3)*Y)):128:128
Generate a fancy enigmatic moving light:
nullsrc=s=256x256,geq=random(1)/hypot(X-cos(N*0.07)*W/2-W/2,Y-sin(N*0.09)*H/2-H/2)^2*1000000*sin(N*0.02):128:128
Generate a quick emboss effect:
format=gray,geq=lum_expr=’(p(X,Y)+(256-p(X-4,Y-4)))/2’
Modify RGB components depending on pixel position:
geq=r=’X/W*r(X,Y)’:g=’(1-X/W)*g(X,Y)’:b=’(H-Y)/H*b(X,Y)’
Create a radial gradient that is the same size as the input (also see the vignette filter):
geq=lum=255*gauss((X/W-0.5)*3)*gauss((Y/H-0.5)*3)/gauss(0)/gauss(0),format=gray
10.83 gradfun
Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat regions by truncation to 8-bit color depth. Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and dither them.</p>
<p>It is designed for playback only. Do not use it prior to lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and bring back the bands.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>strength
The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from .51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.</p>
<p>radius
The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string: strength[:radius]</p>
<p>10.83.1 Examples
Apply the filter with a 3.5 strength and radius of 8:
gradfun=3.5:8
Specify radius, omitting the strength (which will fall-back to the default value):
gradfun=radius=8
10.84 graphmonitor, agraphmonitor

<p>10.85 greyedge
A color constancy variation filter which estimates scene illumination via grey edge algorithm and corrects the scene colors accordingly.</p>
<p>See: <a class="reference external" href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/th.gevers/pub/GeversTIP07.pdf">https://staff.science.uva.nl/th.gevers/pub/GeversTIP07.pdf</a></p>

<p>difford
The order of differentiation to be applied on the scene. Must be chosen in the range [0,2] and default value is 1.</p>
<p>minknorm
The Minkowski parameter to be used for calculating the Minkowski distance. Must be chosen in the range [0,20] and default value is 1. Set to 0 for getting max value instead of calculating Minkowski distance.</p>
<p>sigma

10.86 haldclut
Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.</p>
<p>First input is the video stream to process, and second one is the Hald CLUT. The Hald CLUT input can be a simple picture or a complete video stream.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>shortest
Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is 0.</p>
<p>repeatlast
Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of 0 disable the filter after the last frame of the CLUT is reached. Default is 1.</p>
<p>haldclut also has the same interpolation options as lut3d (both filters share the same internals).</p>
<p>This filter also supports the framesync options.</p>
<p>More information about the Hald CLUT can be found on Eskil Steenberg’s website (Hald CLUT author) at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html">http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html</a>.</p>
<p>10.86.1 Workflow examples
10.86.1.1 Hald CLUT video stream
Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with various effects:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -f lavfi -i haldclutsrc=8 -vf “hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process” -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut
Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.</p>
<p>Then use it with haldclut to apply it on some random stream:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -f lavfi -i mandelbrot -i clut.nut -filter_complex ‘[0][1] haldclut’ -t 20 mandelclut.mkv
The Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds (duration of clut.nut), then the latest picture of that CLUT stream will be applied to the remaining frames of the mandelbrot stream.</p>
<p>10.86.1.2 Hald CLUT with preview
A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of Level*Level*Level by Level*Level*Level pixels. For a given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the biggest possible square starting at the top left of the picture. The remaining padding pixels (bottom or right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add a preview of the Hald CLUT.</p>
<p>Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be supported by the haldclut filter:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>ffmpeg -f lavfi -i haldclutsrc=8 -vf “</dt><dd><p>pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
[padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
[main][b] overlay=W-320” -frames:v 1 clut.png</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It contains the original and a preview of the effect of the CLUT: SMPTE color bars are displayed on the right-top, and below the same color bars processed by the color changes.</p>
<p>Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized with:</p>
<p>ffplay input.mkv -vf “movie=clut.png, [in] haldclut”
10.87 hflip
Flip the input video horizontally.</p>
<p>For example, to horizontally flip the input video with ffmpeg:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf “hflip” out.avi
10.88 histeq
This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a per-frame basis.</p>
<p>It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel intensities. The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be viewed as an “automatically adjusting contrast filter”. This filter is useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source video.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>strength
Determine the amount of equalization to be applied. As the strength is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.</p>
<p>intensity
Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output values appropriately. The strength should be set as desired and then the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.</p>
<p>antibanding
Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of the histogram. Possible values are none, weak or strong. It defaults to none.</p>
<p>10.89 histogram
Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.</p>
<p>The computed histogram is a representation of the color component distribution in an image.</p>
<p>Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image. Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>level_height
Set height of level. Default value is 200. Allowed range is [50, 2048].</p>
<p>scale_height
Set height of color scale. Default value is 12. Allowed range is [0, 40].</p>
<p>display_mode
Set display mode. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘stack’
Per color component graphs are placed below each other.</p>
<p>‘parade’
Per color component graphs are placed side by side.</p>
<p>‘overlay’
Presents information identical to that in the parade, except that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly over one another.</p>
<p>Default is stack.</p>
<p>levels_mode
Set mode. Can be either linear, or logarithmic. Default is linear.</p>
<p>components
Set what color components to display. Default is 7.</p>
<p>fgopacity
Set foreground opacity. Default is 0.7.</p>
<p>bgopacity
Set background opacity. Default is 0.5.</p>
<p>10.89.1 Examples
Calculate and draw histogram:
ffplay -i input -vf histogram
10.90 hqdn3d
This is a high precision/quality 3d denoise filter. It aims to reduce image noise, producing smooth images and making still images really still. It should enhance compressibility.</p>
<p>It accepts the following optional parameters:</p>
<p>luma_spatial
A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial luma strength. It defaults to 4.0.</p>
<p>chroma_spatial
A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial chroma strength. It defaults to 3.0*luma_spatial/4.0.</p>
<p>luma_tmp
A floating point number which specifies luma temporal strength. It defaults to 6.0*luma_spatial/4.0.</p>
<p>chroma_tmp
A floating point number which specifies chroma temporal strength. It defaults to luma_tmp*chroma_spatial/luma_spatial.</p>
<p>10.91 hwdownload
Download hardware frames to system memory.</p>
<p>The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a non-hardware format. Not all formats will be supported on the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional format filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.</p>
<p>10.92 hwmap
Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.</p>
<p>This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends on the input and output formats:</p>
<p>Hardware frame input, normal frame output
Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output. If the original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying something else on part of it), the hwmap filter can be used again in the next mode to retrieve it.</p>
<p>Normal frame input, hardware frame output
If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it - that is, return the original hardware frame.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a device must be provided. Create new hardware surfaces on that device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input and give those frames to the preceding filter. This will then act like the hwupload filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when the input is already in a compatible format.</p>
<p>Hardware frame input and output
A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the derive_device option. The input and output devices must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).</p>
<p>If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap to retrieve the original frames.</p>
<p>Otherwise, map the frames to the output device - create new hardware frames on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.</p>
<p>The following additional parameters are accepted:</p>
<p>mode
Set the frame mapping mode. Some combination of:</p>
<p>read
The mapped frame should be readable.</p>
<p>write
The mapped frame should be writeable.</p>
<p>overwrite
The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.</p>
<p>This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the frame need not be loaded.</p>
<p>direct
The mapping must not involve any copying.</p>
<p>Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties. Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is not possible.</p>
<p>Defaults to read+write if not specified.</p>
<p>derive_device type
Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new device of type type from the device the input frames exist on.</p>
<p>reverse
In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink and map them back to the source. This may be necessary in some cases where a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is supported by the devices being used.</p>
<p>This option is dangerous - it may break the preceding filter in undefined ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter’s output. Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.</p>
<p>10.93 hwupload
Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.</p>
<p>The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is initialised. If using ffmpeg, select the appropriate device with the -filter_hw_device option.</p>
<p>10.94 hwupload_cuda
Upload system memory frames to a CUDA device.</p>
<p>It accepts the following optional parameters:</p>
<p>device
The number of the CUDA device to use</p>
<p>10.95 hqx
Apply a high-quality magnification filter designed for pixel art. This filter was originally created by Maxim Stepin.</p>
<p>It accepts the following option:</p>
<p>n
Set the scaling dimension: 2 for hq2x, 3 for hq3x and 4 for hq4x. Default is 3.</p>
<p>10.96 hstack
Stack input videos horizontally.</p>
<p>All streams must be of same pixel format and of same height.</p>
<p>Note that this filter is faster than using overlay and pad filter to create same output.</p>
<p>The filter accept the following option:</p>
<p>inputs
Set number of input streams. Default is 2.</p>
<p>shortest
If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>10.97 hue
Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>h
Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts an expression, and defaults to “0”.</p>
<p>s
Specify the saturation in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and defaults to “1”.</p>
<p>H
Specify the hue angle as a number of radians. It accepts an expression, and defaults to “0”.</p>
<p>b
Specify the brightness in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and defaults to “0”.</p>
<p>h and H are mutually exclusive, and can’t be specified at the same time.</p>
<p>The b, h, H and s option values are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>n
frame count of the input frame starting from 0</p>
<p>pts
presentation timestamp of the input frame expressed in time base units</p>
<p>r
frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is unknown</p>
<p>t
timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown</p>
<p>tb
time base of the input video</p>
<p>10.97.1 Examples
Set the hue to 90 degrees and the saturation to 1.0:
hue=h=90:s=1
Same command but expressing the hue in radians:
hue=H=PI/2:s=1
Rotate hue and make the saturation swing between 0 and 2 over a period of 1 second:
hue=”H=2*PI*t: s=sin(2*PI*t)+1”
Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:
hue=”s=min(t/3,1)”
The general fade-in expression can be written as:</p>
<p>hue=”s=min(0, max((t-START)/DURATION, 1))”
Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-out effect starting at 5 seconds:
hue=”s=max(0, min(1, (8-t)/3))”
The general fade-out expression can be written as:</p>
<p>hue=”s=max(0, min(1, (START+DURATION-t)/DURATION))”
10.97.2 Commands
This filter supports the following commands:</p>
<p>b
s
h
H
Modify the hue and/or the saturation and/or brightness of the input video. The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.</p>
<p>If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.</p>
<p>10.98 hysteresis
Grow first stream into second stream by connecting components. This makes it possible to build more robust edge masks.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>planes
Set which planes will be processed as bitmap, unprocessed planes will be copied from first stream. By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.</p>
<p>threshold
Set threshold which is used in filtering. If pixel component value is higher than this value filter algorithm for connecting components is activated. By default value is 0.</p>
<p>10.99 idet
Detect video interlacing type.</p>
<p>This filter tries to detect if the input frames are interlaced, progressive, top or bottom field first. It will also try to detect fields that are repeated between adjacent frames (a sign of telecine).</p>
<p>Single frame detection considers only immediately adjacent frames when classifying each frame. Multiple frame detection incorporates the classification history of previous frames.</p>
<p>The filter will log these metadata values:</p>
<p>single.current_frame

<p>rep_thres
Threshold for repeated field detection.</p>
<p>half_life
Number of frames after which a given frame’s contribution to the statistics is halved (i.e., it contributes only 0.5 to its classification). The default of 0 means that all frames seen are given full weight of 1.0 forever.</p>
<p>analyze_interlaced_flag
When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames. If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared without any further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational method to clean up the interlaced flag</p>
<p>10.100 il
Deinterleave or interleave fields.</p>
<p>This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2 fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the top half of the output image, even lines to the bottom half. You can process (filter) them independently and then re-interleave them.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>luma_mode, l

<p>10.102 interlace
Simple interlacing filter from progressive contents. This interleaves upper (or lower) lines from odd frames with lower (or upper) lines from even frames, halving the frame rate and preserving image height.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The description of the accepted parameters follows.</p>
<p>thresh
Set the threshold which affects the filter’s tolerance when determining if a pixel line must be processed. It must be an integer in the range [0,255] and defaults to 10. A value of 0 will result in applying the process on every pixels.</p>
<p>map

<p>10.105 lenscorrection
Correct radial lens distortion</p>
<p>This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error. To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.</p>
<p>Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and Digikam from the KDE project.</p>
<p>In contrast to the vignette filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors, this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas vignette corrects the brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should be applied before or after lens correction.</p>
<p>10.105.1 Options
The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>cx
Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image width. Default is 0.5.</p>
<p>cy
Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image height. Default is 0.5.</p>
<p>k1
Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means no correction. Default is 0.</p>
<p>k2
Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means no correction. Default is 0.</p>
<p>The formula that generates the correction is:</p>
<p>r_src = r_tgt * (1 + k1 * (r_tgt / r_0)^2 + k2 * (r_tgt / r_0)^4)</p>
<p>where r_0 is halve of the image diagonal and r_src and r_tgt are the distances from the focal point in the source and target images, respectively.</p>
<p>10.106 lensfun
Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (<a class="reference external" href="http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/">http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/</a>).</p>
<p>The lensfun filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level “info”). You must provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>make
The make of the camera (for example, “Canon”). This option is required.</p>
<p>model
The model of the camera (for example, “Canon EOS 100D”). This option is required.</p>
<p>lens_model
The model of the lens (for example, “Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM”). This option is required.</p>
<p>mode
The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options:</p>
<p>‘vignetting’
Enables fixing lens vignetting.</p>
<p>‘geometry’
Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default.</p>
<p>‘subpixel’
Enables fixing chromatic aberrations.</p>
<p>‘vig_geo’
Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry.</p>
<p>‘vig_subpixel’
Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.</p>
<p>‘distortion’
Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations.</p>
<p>‘all’
Enables all possible corrections.</p>
<p>focal_length
The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For example, a 18–55mm lens has focal length range of [18–55], so a value in that range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.</p>
<p>aperture
The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.</p>
<p>focus_distance
The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which is 1000).</p>
<p>scale
The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid unmapped areas in the output.</p>
<p>target_geometry
The target geometry of the output image/video. The following values are valid options:</p>
<p>‘rectilinear (default)’
‘fisheye’
‘panoramic’

‘fisheye_equisolid’
‘fisheye_thoby’
reverse

<p>A description of the accepted options follows.</p>
<p>max
Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if positive), or the minimum interval between dropped frames (if negative). If the value is 0, the frame is dropped disregarding the number of previous sequentially dropped frames.</p>
<p>Default value is 0.</p>
<p>hi
lo
frac
Set the dropping threshold values.</p>
<p>Values for hi and lo are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the same spread out differently over the block.</p>

Mandatory option, without binary file filter can not work. Currently file can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3/blob/master/src/nnedi3_weights.bin">https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3/blob/master/src/nnedi3_weights.bin</a></p>

<p>‘s’
weights trained to minimize squared error</p>
<p>pscrn
Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is used to decide which pixels should be processed by the predictor neural network and which can be handled by simple cubic interpolation. The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn. The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation, using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing. The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not using it is almost always unnoticeable.</p>
<p>Can be one of the following:</p>
<p>‘none’
‘original’
‘new’
Default is new.</p>
<p>fapprox

10.130 normalize
Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching). See: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing</a>)</p>
<p>For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white.</p>
<p>Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over- or under-exposure of the video.</p>
<p>The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some color shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents color shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked normalization can be combined in any ratio.</p>
<p>The normalize filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>blackpt
whitept
Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to the blackpt. The maximum input value is mapped to the whitept. The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for blackpt and black for whitept will give color-inverted, normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range (contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting effects.</p>
<p>smoothing
The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The input range of each channel is smoothed using a rolling average over the current frame and the smoothing previous frames. The default is 0 (no temporal smoothing).</p>
<p>independence
Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to linked (color preserving) normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).</p>
<p>strength
Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather expensive no-op. Defaults to 1.0 (full strength).</p>
<p>10.130.1 Examples
Stretch video contrast to use the full dynamic range, with no temporal smoothing; may flicker depending on the source content:</p>
<p>normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=0
As above, but with 50 frames of temporal smoothing; flicker should be reduced, depending on the source content:</p>
<p>normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50
As above, but with hue-preserving linked channel normalization:</p>
<p>normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0
As above, but with half strength:</p>
<p>normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0:strength=0.5
Map the darkest input color to red, the brightest input color to cyan:</p>
<p>normalize=blackpt=red:whitept=cyan
10.131 null
Pass the video source unchanged to the output.</p>
<p>10.132 ocr

<p>The filter exports recognized text as the frame metadata lavfi.ocr.text. The filter exports confidence of recognized words as the frame metadata lavfi.ocr.confidence.</p>
<p>10.133 ocv
Apply a video transform using libopencv.</p>
<p>To enable this filter, install the libopencv library and headers and configure FFmpeg with –enable-libopencv.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>filter_name
The name of the libopencv filter to apply.</p>
<p>filter_params
The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not specified, the default values are assumed.</p>
<p>Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise information: <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html">http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html</a></p>
<p>Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.</p>
<p>10.133.1 dilate
Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element. It corresponds to the libopencv function cvDilate.</p>
<p>It accepts the parameters: struct_el|nb_iterations.</p>
<p>struct_el represents a structuring element, and has the syntax: colsxrows+anchor_xxanchor_y/shape</p>
<p>cols and rows represent the number of columns and rows of the structuring element, anchor_x and anchor_y the anchor point, and shape the shape for the structuring element. shape must be “rect”, “cross”, “ellipse”, or “custom”.</p>
<p>If the value for shape is “custom”, it must be followed by a string of the form “=filename”. The file with name filename is assumed to represent a binary image, with each printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom shape is used, cols and rows are ignored, the number or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.</p>
<p>The default value for struct_el is “3x3+0x0/rect”.</p>
<p>nb_iterations specifies the number of times the transform is applied to the image, and defaults to 1.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p># Use the default values
ocv=dilate</p>
<p># Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2</p>
<p># Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
# The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
#   *
#  <strong>*
# ***</strong>
#  <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">**</span></a>*
#   *
# The specified columns and rows are ignored
# but the anchor point coordinates are not
ocv=dilate:0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape|2
10.133.2 erode
Erode an image by using a specific structuring element. It corresponds to the libopencv function cvErode.</p>
<p>It accepts the parameters: struct_el:nb_iterations, with the same syntax and semantics as the dilate filter.</p>
<p>10.133.3 smooth
Smooth the input video.</p>
<p>The filter takes the following parameters: type|param1|param2|param3|param4.</p>
<p>type is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of the following values: “blur”, “blur_no_scale”, “median”, “gaussian”, or “bilateral”. The default value is “gaussian”.</p>
<p>The meaning of param1, param2, param3, and param4 depend on the smooth type. param1 and param2 accept integer positive values or 0. param3 and param4 accept floating point values.</p>
<p>The default value for param1 is 3. The default value for the other parameters is 0.</p>
<p>These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the libopencv function cvSmooth.</p>

oscilloscope=x=1:y=0.5:s=1:t=1
10.135 overlay
Overlay one video on top of another.</p>
<p>It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the “main” video on which the second input is overlaid.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>A description of the accepted options follows.</p>
<p>x
y
Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video. Default value is “0” for both expressions. In case the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning that the overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).</p>
<p>eof_action
See framesync.</p>
<p>eval
Set when the expressions for x, and y are evaluated.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘init’
only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed</p>
<p>‘frame’
evaluate expressions for each incoming frame</p>
<p>Default value is ‘frame’.</p>
<p>shortest
See framesync.</p>
<p>format
Set the format for the output video.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘yuv420’
force YUV420 output</p>
<p>‘yuv422’
force YUV422 output</p>
<p>‘yuv444’
force YUV444 output</p>
<p>‘rgb’
force packed RGB output</p>
<p>‘gbrp’

<p>The x, and y expressions can contain the following parameters.</p>
<p>main_w, W
main_h, H
The main input width and height.</p>
<p>overlay_w, w
overlay_h, h
The overlay input width and height.</p>
<p>x
y
The computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for each new frame.</p>
<p>hsub
vsub
horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values of the output format. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>n
the number of input frame, starting from 0</p>
<p>pos
the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown</p>
<p>t
The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.</p>
<p>This filter also supports the framesync options.</p>
<p>Note that the n, pos, t variables are available only when evaluation is done per frame, and will evaluate to NAN when eval is set to ‘init’.</p>
<p>Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea to pass the two inputs through a setpts=PTS-STARTPTS filter to have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for the movie filter does.</p>
<p>You can chain together more overlays but you should test the efficiency of such approach.</p>
<p>10.135.1 Commands
This filter supports the following commands:</p>
<p>x
y
Modify the x and y of the overlay input. The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.</p>
<p>If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.</p>
<p>10.135.2 Examples
Draw the overlay at 10 pixels from the bottom right corner of the main video:
overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10
Using named options the example above becomes:</p>
<p>overlay=x=main_w-overlay_w-10:y=main_h-overlay_h-10
Insert a transparent PNG logo in the bottom left corner of the input, using the ffmpeg tool with the -filter_complex option:
ffmpeg -i input -i logo -filter_complex ‘overlay=10:main_h-overlay_h-10’ output
Insert 2 different transparent PNG logos (second logo on bottom right corner) using the ffmpeg tool:
ffmpeg -i input -i logo1 -i logo2 -filter_complex ‘overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10,overlay=x=W-w-10:y=H-h-10’ output
Add a transparent color layer on top of the main video; WxH must specify the size of the main input to the overlay filter:
color=color=red&#64;.3:size=WxH [over]; [in][over] overlay [out]
Play an original video and a filtered version (here with the deshake filter) side by side using the ffplay tool:
ffplay input.avi -vf ‘split[a][b]; [a]pad=iw*2:ih[src]; [b]deshake[filt]; [src][filt]overlay=w’
The above command is the same as:</p>
<p>ffplay input.avi -vf ‘split[b], pad=iw*2[src], [b]deshake, [src]overlay=w’
Make a sliding overlay appearing from the left to the right top part of the screen starting since time 2:
overlay=x=’if(gte(t,2), -w+(t-2)*20, NAN)’:y=0
Compose output by putting two input videos side to side:
ffmpeg -i left.avi -i right.avi -filter_complex ”
nullsrc=size=200x100 [background];
[0:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [left];
[1:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [right];
[background][left]       overlay=shortest=1       [background+left];
[background+left][right] overlay=shortest=1:x=100 [left+right]
”
Mask 10-20 seconds of a video by applying the delogo filter to a section
ffmpeg -i test.avi -codec:v:0 wmv2 -ar 11025 -b:v 9000k
-vf ‘[in]split[split_main][split_delogo];[split_delogo]trim=start=360:end=371,delogo=0:0:640:480[delogoed];[split_main][delogoed]overlay=eof_action=pass[out]’
masked.avi
Chain several overlays in cascade:
nullsrc=s=200x200 [bg];
testsrc=s=100x100, split=4 [in0][in1][in2][in3];
[in0] lutrgb=r=0, [bg]   overlay=0:0     [mid0];
[in1] lutrgb=g=0, [mid0] overlay=100:0   [mid1];
[in2] lutrgb=b=0, [mid1] overlay=0:100   [mid2];

<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>width, w
height, h
Specify an expression for the size of the output image with the paddings added. If the value for width or height is 0, the corresponding input size is used for the output.</p>
<p>The width expression can reference the value set by the height expression, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The default value of width and height is 0.</p>
<p>x
y
Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area, with respect to the top/left border of the output image.</p>
<p>The x expression can reference the value set by the y expression, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The default value of x and y is 0.</p>
<p>If x or y evaluate to a negative number, they’ll be changed so the input image is centered on the padded area.</p>
<p>color
Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>The default value of color is “black”.</p>
<p>eval
Specify when to evaluate width, height, x and y expression.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘init’
Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed.</p>
<p>‘frame’
Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘init’.</p>
<p>aspect
Pad to aspect instead to a resolution.</p>
<p>The value for the width, height, x, and y options are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>in_w
in_h
The input video width and height.</p>
<p>iw
ih
These are the same as in_w and in_h.</p>
<p>out_w
out_h
The output width and height (the size of the padded area), as specified by the width and height expressions.</p>
<p>ow
oh
These are the same as out_w and out_h.</p>
<p>x
y
The x and y offsets as specified by the x and y expressions, or NAN if not yet specified.</p>
<p>a
same as iw / ih</p>
<p>sar
input sample aspect ratio</p>
<p>dar
input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar</p>
<p>hsub
vsub
The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>10.137.1 Examples
Add paddings with the color “violet” to the input video. The output video size is 640x480, and the top-left corner of the input video is placed at column 0, row 40
pad=640:480:0:40:violet
The example above is equivalent to the following command:</p>
<p>pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet
Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2, and put the input video at the center of the padded area:
pad=”3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2”
Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum value between the input width and height, and put the input video at the center of the padded area:
pad=”max(iw,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2”
Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:
pad=”ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2”
In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display aspect correctly, it is necessary to use sar in the expression, according to the relation:
(ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
X = output_dar / sar
Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:</p>
<p>pad=”ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2”
Double the output size and put the input video in the bottom-right corner of the output padded area:
pad=”2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih”
10.138 palettegen
Generate one palette for a whole video stream.</p>
<p>It accepts the following options:</p>
<p>max_colors
Set the maximum number of colors to quantize in the palette. Note: the palette will still contain 256 colors; the unused palette entries will be black.</p>
<p>reserve_transparent
Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the last one for transparency. Reserving the transparency color is useful for GIF optimization. If not set, the maximum of colors in the palette will be 256. You probably want to disable this option for a standalone image. Set by default.</p>
<p>transparency_color
Set the color that will be used as background for transparency.</p>
<p>stats_mode
Set statistics mode.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘full’
Compute full frame histograms.</p>
<p>‘diff’
Compute histograms only for the part that differs from previous frame. This might be relevant to give more importance to the moving part of your input if the background is static.</p>
<p>‘single’
Compute new histogram for each frame.</p>
<p>Default value is full.</p>
<p>The filter also exports the frame metadata lavfi.color_quant_ratio (nb_color_in / nb_color_out) which you can use to evaluate the degree of color quantization of the palette. This information is also visible at info logging level.</p>
<p>10.138.1 Examples
Generate a representative palette of a given video using ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf palettegen palette.png
10.139 paletteuse
Use a palette to downsample an input video stream.</p>
<p>The filter takes two inputs: one video stream and a palette. The palette must be a 256 pixels image.</p>
<p>It accepts the following options:</p>
<p>dither
Select dithering mode. Available algorithms are:</p>
<p>‘bayer’
Ordered 8x8 bayer dithering (deterministic)</p>
<p>‘heckbert’
Dithering as defined by Paul Heckbert in 1982 (simple error diffusion). Note: this dithering is sometimes considered “wrong” and is included as a reference.</p>
<p>‘floyd_steinberg’
Floyd and Steingberg dithering (error diffusion)</p>
<p>‘sierra2’
Frankie Sierra dithering v2 (error diffusion)</p>
<p>‘sierra2_4a’
Frankie Sierra dithering v2 “Lite” (error diffusion)</p>
<p>Default is sierra2_4a.</p>
<p>bayer_scale
When bayer dithering is selected, this option defines the scale of the pattern (how much the crosshatch pattern is visible). A low value means more visible pattern for less banding, and higher value means less visible pattern at the cost of more banding.</p>
<p>The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is 2.</p>
<p>diff_mode
If set, define the zone to process</p>
<p>‘rectangle’
Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed. This is similar to GIF cropping/offsetting compression mechanism. This option can be useful for speed if only a part of the image is changing, and has use cases such as limiting the scope of the error diffusal dither to the rectangle that bounds the moving scene (it leads to more deterministic output if the scene doesn’t change much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression).</p>
<p>Default is none.</p>
<p>new
Take new palette for each output frame.</p>
<p>alpha_threshold
Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values above this threshold will be treated as completely opaque, and values below this threshold will be treated as completely transparent.</p>
<p>The option must be an integer value in the range [0,255]. Default is 128.</p>
<p>10.139.1 Examples
Use a palette (generated for example with palettegen) to encode a GIF using ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -i palette.png -lavfi paletteuse output.gif

<p>A description of the accepted parameters follows.</p>
<p>mode
Set phase mode.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘t’

<p>kernel
Kernel name in program.</p>
<p>inputs
Number of inputs to the filter. Defaults to 1.</p>
<p>size, s
Size of output frames. Defaults to the same as the first input.</p>
<p>The program source file must contain a kernel function with the given name, which will be run once for each plane of the output. Each run on a plane gets enqueued as a separate 2D global NDRange with one work-item for each pixel to be generated. The global ID offset for each work-item is therefore the coordinates of a pixel in the destination image.</p>
<p>The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:</p>
<p>Destination image, __write_only image2d_t.
This image will become the output; the kernel should write all of it.</p>
<p>Frame index, unsigned int.
This is a counter starting from zero and increasing by one for each frame.</p>
<p>Source images, __read_only image2d_t.
These are the most recent images on each input. The kernel may read from them to generate the output, but they can’t be written to.</p>
<p>Example programs:</p>
<p>Copy the input to the output (output must be the same size as the input).
__kernel void copy(__write_only image2d_t destination,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>unsigned int index,
__read_only  image2d_t source)</p>

set pixel first component expression</p>
<p>c1
set pixel second component expression</p>
<p>c2
set pixel third component expression</p>
<p>c3
set pixel fourth component expression, corresponds to the alpha component</p>
<p>i
set component to use as base for altering colors</p>
<p>Each of them specifies the expression to use for computing the lookup table for the corresponding pixel component values.</p>
<p>The expressions can contain the following constants and functions:</p>

h
The input width and height.</p>
<p>val
The input value for the pixel component.</p>
<p>ymin, umin, vmin, amin

pseudocolor=“‘if(between(val,ymax,amax),lerp(ymin,ymax,(val-ymax)/(amax-ymax)),-1):if(between(val,ymax,amax),lerp(umax,umin,(val-ymax)/(amax-ymax)),-1):if(between(val,ymax,amax),lerp(vmin,vmax,(val-ymax)/(amax-ymax)),-1):-1’”
10.150 psnr
Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) between two input videos.</p>
<p>This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is considered the “main” source and is passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used as a “reference” video for computing the PSNR.</p>
<p>Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.</p>
<p>The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.</p>
<p>The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:</p>
<p>PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)
Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the image.</p>
<p>The description of the accepted parameters follows.</p>
<p>stats_file, f
If specified the filter will use the named file to save the PSNR of each individual frame. When filename equals “-” the data is sent to standard output.</p>
<p>stats_version
Specifies which version of the stats file format to use. Details of each format are written below. Default value is 1.</p>
<p>stats_add_max
Determines whether the max value is output to the stats log. Default value is 0. Requires stats_version &gt;= 2. If this is set and stats_version &lt; 2, the filter will return an error.</p>
<p>This filter also supports the framesync options.</p>
<p>The file printed if stats_file is selected, contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form key:value for each compared couple of frames.</p>
<p>If a stats_version greater than 1 is specified, a header line precedes the list of per-frame-pair stats, with key value pairs following the frame format with the following parameters:</p>
<p>psnr_log_version
The version of the log file format. Will match stats_version.</p>
<p>fields
A comma separated list of the per-frame-pair parameters included in the log.</p>
<p>A description of each shown per-frame-pair parameter follows:</p>
<p>n
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1</p>
<p>mse_avg
Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared frames, averaged over all the image components.</p>
<p>mse_y, mse_u, mse_v, mse_r, mse_g, mse_b, mse_a
Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.</p>
<p>psnr_y, psnr_u, psnr_v, psnr_r, psnr_g, psnr_b, psnr_a
Peak Signal to Noise ratio of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.</p>
<p>max_avg, max_y, max_u, max_v
Maximum allowed value for each channel, and average over all channels.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
[main][ref] psnr=”stats_file=stats.log” [out]
On this example the input file being processed is compared with the reference file ref_movie.mpg. The PSNR of each individual frame is stored in stats.log.</p>
<p>10.151 pullup
Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.</p>
<p>The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.</p>
<p>To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after pullup, use fps=24000/1001 if the input frame rate is 29.97fps, fps=24 for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>jl
jr
jt
jb
These options set the amount of “junk” to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines. The default is 8 pixels on each side.</p>
<p>sb
Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences. Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily. This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>mp
Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘l’
Use luma plane.</p>
<p>‘u’
Use chroma blue plane.</p>
<p>‘v’
Use chroma red plane.</p>
<p>This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane for doing filter’s computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video. The main purpose of setting mp to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.</p>
<p>For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse telecine NTSC input:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 …
10.152 qp
Change video quantization parameters (QP).</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following option:</p>
<p>qp
Set expression for quantization parameter.</p>
<p>The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain, among others, the following constants:</p>
<p>known
1 if index is not 129, 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>qp
Sequential index starting from -129 to 128.</p>
<p>10.152.1 Examples
Some equation like:
qp=2+2*sin(PI*qp)
10.153 random
Flush video frames from internal cache of frames into a random order. No frame is discarded. Inspired by frei0r nervous filter.</p>

Set size in number of frames of internal cache, in range from 2 to 512. Default is 30.</p>
<p>seed
Set seed for random number generator, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to less than 0, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.</p>
<p>10.154 readeia608
Read closed captioning (EIA-608) information from the top lines of a video frame.</p>
<p>This filter adds frame metadata for lavfi.readeia608.X.cc and lavfi.readeia608.X.line, where X is the number of the identified line with EIA-608 data (starting from 0). A description of each metadata value follows:</p>

<p>lavfi.readeia608.X.line
The number of the line on which the EIA-608 data was identified and read.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>scan_min
Set the line to start scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 0.</p>
<p>scan_max
Set the line to end scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 29.</p>

10.155 readvitc
Read vertical interval timecode (VITC) information from the top lines of a video frame.</p>
<p>The filter adds frame metadata key lavfi.readvitc.tc_str with the timecode value, if a valid timecode has been detected. Further metadata key lavfi.readvitc.found is set to 0/1 depending on whether timecode data has been found or not.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>scan_max
Set the maximum number of lines to scan for VITC data. If the value is set to -1 the full video frame is scanned. Default is 45.</p>
<p>thr_b
Set the luma threshold for black. Accepts float numbers in the range [0.0,1.0], default value is 0.2. The value must be equal or less than thr_w.</p>
<p>thr_w
Set the luma threshold for white. Accepts float numbers in the range [0.0,1.0], default value is 0.6. The value must be equal or greater than thr_b.</p>
<p>10.155.1 Examples
Detect and draw VITC data onto the video frame; if no valid VITC is detected, draw –:–:–:– as a placeholder:
ffmpeg -i input.avi -filter:v ‘readvitc,drawtext=fontfile=FreeMono.ttf:text=%{metadata\:lavfi.readvitc.tc_str\:–\\:–\\:–\\:–}:x=(w-tw)/2:y=400-ascent’
10.156 remap
Remap pixels using 2nd: Xmap and 3rd: Ymap input video stream.</p>
<p>Destination pixel at position (X, Y) will be picked from source (x, y) position where x = Xmap(X, Y) and y = Ymap(X, Y). If mapping values are out of range, zero value for pixel will be used for destination pixel.</p>
<p>Xmap and Ymap input video streams must be of same dimensions. Output video stream will have Xmap/Ymap video stream dimensions. Xmap and Ymap input video streams are 16bit depth, single channel.</p>

<p>10.158 removelogo
Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>filename, f
Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the video stream being processed.</p>
<p>Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode filter once or twice.</p>
<p>If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra pixels will slow things down on a large logo.</p>
<p>10.159 repeatfields
This filter uses the repeat_field flag from the Video ES headers and hard repeats fields based on its value.</p>
<p>10.160 reverse
Reverse a video clip.</p>
<p>Warning: This filter requires memory to buffer the entire clip, so trimming is suggested.</p>

<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>A description of the optional parameters follows.</p>
<p>angle, a
Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video clockwise, expressed as a number of radians. A negative value will result in a counter-clockwise rotation. By default it is set to “0”.</p>
<p>This expression is evaluated for each frame.</p>
<p>out_w, ow
Set the output width expression, default value is “iw”. This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.</p>
<p>out_h, oh

<p>bilinear
Enable bilinear interpolation if set to 1, a value of 0 disables it. Default value is 1.</p>
<p>fillcolor, c
Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by the rotated image. For the general syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value “none” is selected then no background is printed (useful for example if the background is never shown).</p>
<p>Default value is “black”.</p>
<p>The expressions for the angle and the output size can contain the following constants and functions:</p>
<p>n
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0. It is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.</p>
<p>t
time in seconds of the input frame, it is set to 0 when the filter is configured. It is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.</p>
<p>hsub

the output width and height, that is the size of the padded area as specified by the width and height expressions</p>
<p>rotw(a)
roth(a)
the minimal width/height required for completely containing the input video rotated by a radians.</p>
<p>These are only available when computing the out_w and out_h expressions.</p>
<p>10.163.1 Examples
Rotate the input by PI/6 radians clockwise:
rotate=PI/6
Rotate the input by PI/6 radians counter-clockwise:
rotate=-PI/6
Rotate the input by 45 degrees clockwise:
rotate=45*PI/180
Apply a constant rotation with period T, starting from an angle of PI/3:
rotate=PI/3+2*PI*t/T
Make the input video rotation oscillating with a period of T seconds and an amplitude of A radians:
rotate=A*sin(2*PI/T*t)
Rotate the video, output size is chosen so that the whole rotating input video is always completely contained in the output:
rotate=‘2*PI*t:ow=hypot(iw,ih):oh=ow’
Rotate the video, reduce the output size so that no background is ever shown:
rotate=2*PI*t:ow=’min(iw,ih)/sqrt(2)’:oh=ow:c=none
10.163.2 Commands
The filter supports the following commands:</p>
<p>a, angle
Set the angle expression. The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.</p>
<p>If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.</p>
<p>10.164 sab
Apply Shape Adaptive Blur.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>luma_radius, lr
Set luma blur filter strength, must be a value in range 0.1-4.0, default value is 1.0. A greater value will result in a more blurred image, and in slower processing.</p>

<p>Each chroma option value, if not explicitly specified, is set to the corresponding luma option value.</p>
<p>10.165 scale
Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.</p>
<p>The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If the input image format is different from the format requested by the next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the requested format.</p>
<p>10.165.1 Options
The filter accepts the following options, or any of the options supported by the libswscale scaler.</p>
<p>See (ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler manual for the complete list of scaler options.</p>
<p>width, w
height, h
Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension.</p>
<p>If the width or w value is 0, the input width is used for the output. If the height or h value is 0, the input height is used for the output.</p>
<p>If one and only one of the values is -n with n &gt;= 1, the scale filter will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image, calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will, however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and adjust the value if necessary.</p>
<p>If both values are -n with n &gt;= 1, the behavior will be identical to both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.</p>
<p>See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension expression.</p>
<p>eval
Specify when to evaluate width and height expression. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘init’
Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed.</p>
<p>‘frame’
Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘init’.</p>
<p>interl
Set the interlacing mode. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘1’
Force interlaced aware scaling.</p>
<p>‘0’
Do not apply interlaced scaling.</p>
<p>‘-1’
Select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source frames are flagged as interlaced or not.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘0’.</p>
<p>flags
Set libswscale scaling flags. See (ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler manual for the complete list of values. If not explicitly specified the filter applies the default flags.</p>
<p>param0, param1
Set libswscale input parameters for scaling algorithms that need them. See (ffmpeg-scaler)the ffmpeg-scaler manual for the complete documentation. If not explicitly specified the filter applies empty parameters.</p>
<p>size, s
Set the video size. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>in_color_matrix
out_color_matrix
Set in/output YCbCr color space type.</p>
<p>This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing a specific value used for the output and encoder.</p>
<p>If not specified, the color space type depends on the pixel format.</p>
<p>Possible values:</p>
<p>‘auto’
Choose automatically.</p>
<p>‘bt709’
Format conforming to International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation BT.709.</p>
<p>‘fcc’
Set color space conforming to the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 (2003) 73.682 (a).</p>
<p>‘bt601’
Set color space conforming to:</p>
<p>ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) Recommendation BT.601
ITU-R Rec. BT.470-6 (1998) Systems B, B1, and G
Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) ST 170:2004
‘smpte240m’
Set color space conforming to SMPTE ST 240:1999.</p>
<p>in_range
out_range
Set in/output YCbCr sample range.</p>
<p>This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing a specific value used for the output and encoder. If not specified, the range depends on the pixel format. Possible values:</p>
<p>‘auto/unknown’
Choose automatically.</p>
<p>‘jpeg/full/pc’
Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).</p>
<p>‘mpeg/limited/tv’
Set “MPEG” range (16-235 in case of 8-bit luma).</p>
<p>force_original_aspect_ratio
Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values:</p>
<p>‘disable’
Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.</p>
<p>‘decrease’
The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.</p>
<p>‘increase’
The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.</p>
<p>One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device’s maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows 1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output 1280x533.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for w or h, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option to work.</p>
<p>The values of the w and h options are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>in_w
in_h
The input width and height</p>
<p>iw
ih
These are the same as in_w and in_h.</p>
<p>out_w

<p>dar
The input display aspect ratio. Calculated from (iw / ih) * sar.</p>
<p>hsub
vsub
horizontal and vertical input chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>ohsub
ovsub
horizontal and vertical output chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>10.165.2 Examples

Specify a size abbreviation for the output size:
scale=qcif
which can also be written as:</p>
<p>scale=size=qcif
Scale the input to 2x:

10.169 separatefields
The separatefields takes a frame-based video input and splits each frame into its components fields, producing a new half height clip with twice the frame rate and twice the frame count.</p>
<p>This filter use field-dominance information in frame to decide which of each pair of fields to place first in the output. If it gets it wrong use setfield filter before separatefields filter.</p>
<p>10.170 setdar, setsar
The setdar filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter output video.</p>
<p>This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio, according to the following equation:</p>
<p>DAR = HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION / VERTICAL_RESOLUTION * SAR
Keep in mind that the setdar filter does not modify the pixel dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. in case of scaling or if another “setdar” or a “setsar” filter is applied.</p>
<p>The setsar filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for the filter output video.</p>
<p>Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation above.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the setsar filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if another “setsar” or a “setdar” filter is applied.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>r, ratio, dar (setdar only), sar (setsar only)
Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.</p>
<p>The parameter can be a floating point number string, an expression, or a string of the form num:den, where num and den are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. If the parameter is not specified, it is assumed the value “0”. In case the form “num:den” is used, the : character should be escaped.</p>
<p>max
Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational. Default value is 100.</p>
<p>The parameter sar is an expression containing the following constants:</p>
<p>E, PI, PHI
These are approximated values for the mathematical constants e (Euler’s number), pi (Greek pi), and phi (the golden ratio).</p>
<p>w, h
The input width and height.</p>
<p>a
These are the same as w / h.</p>
<p>sar
The input sample aspect ratio.</p>
<p>dar
The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as (w / h) * sar.</p>
<p>hsub, vsub
Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the pixel format “yuv422p” hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.</p>
<p>10.170.1 Examples
To change the display aspect ratio to 16:9, specify one of the following:
setdar=dar=1.77777
setdar=dar=16/9
To change the sample aspect ratio to 10:11, specify:
setsar=sar=10/11
To set a display aspect ratio of 16:9, and specify a maximum integer value of 1000 in the aspect ratio reduction, use the command:
setdar=ratio=16/9:max=1000

<p>10.180 ssim
Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.</p>
<p>This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is considered the “main” source and is passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used as a “reference” video for computing the SSIM.</p>
<p>Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.</p>
<p>The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.</p>
<p>The description of the accepted parameters follows.</p>
<p>stats_file, f
If specified the filter will use the named file to save the SSIM of each individual frame. When filename equals “-” the data is sent to standard output.</p>
<p>The file printed if stats_file is selected, contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form key:value for each compared couple of frames.</p>
<p>A description of each shown parameter follows:</p>
<p>n
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1</p>
<p>Y, U, V, R, G, B
SSIM of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.</p>
<p>All
SSIM of the compared frames for the whole frame.</p>
<p>dB

<p>This filter also supports the framesync options.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
[main][ref] ssim=”stats_file=stats.log” [out]
On this example the input file being processed is compared with the reference file ref_movie.mpg. The SSIM of each individual frame is stored in stats.log.</p>
<p>Another example with both psnr and ssim at same time:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi  “ssim;[0:v][1:v]psnr” -f null -

<p>delta
Set value which will be added to filtered result.</p>
<p>10.184 spp
Apply a simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the image at several (or - in the case of quality level 6 - all) shifts and average the results.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>quality
Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-6. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 6 means the higher quality. For each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2. Default value is 3.</p>
<p>qp
Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).</p>
<p>mode
Set thresholding mode. Available modes are:</p>
<p>‘hard’
Set hard thresholding (default).</p>
<p>‘soft’
Set soft thresholding (better de-ringing effect, but likely blurrier).</p>
<p>use_bframe_qp
Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).</p>
<p>10.185 sr
Scale the input by applying one of the super-resolution methods based on convolutional neural networks. Supported models:</p>
<p>Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network model (SRCNN). See <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092">https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092</a>.
Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network model (ESPCN). See <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158">https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158</a>.
Training scripts as well as scripts for model generation can be found at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/XueweiMeng/sr/tree/sr_dnn_native">https://github.com/XueweiMeng/sr/tree/sr_dnn_native</a>. Original repository is at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/HighVoltageRocknRoll/sr.git">https://github.com/HighVoltageRocknRoll/sr.git</a>.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>dnn_backend
Specify which DNN backend to use for model loading and execution. This option accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘native’
Native implementation of DNN loading and execution.</p>
<p>‘tensorflow’
TensorFlow backend. To enable this backend you need to install the TensorFlow for C library (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_c">https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_c</a>) and configure FFmpeg with –enable-libtensorflow</p>
<p>Default value is ‘native’.</p>
<p>model
Set path to model file specifying network architecture and its parameters. Note that different backends use different file formats. TensorFlow backend can load files for both formats, while native backend can load files for only its format.</p>
<p>scale_factor
Set scale factor for SRCNN model. Allowed values are 2, 3 and 4. Default value is 2. Scale factor is necessary for SRCNN model, because it accepts input upscaled using bicubic upscaling with proper scale factor.</p>
<p>10.186 subtitles
Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass library.</p>
<p>To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with –enable-libass. This filter also requires a build with libavcodec and libavformat to convert the passed subtitles file to ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles format.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>filename, f
Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.</p>
<p>original_size
Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS file was composed. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic, this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been changed.</p>
<p>fontsdir
Set a directory path containing fonts that can be used by the filter. These fonts will be used in addition to whatever the font provider uses.</p>
<p>alpha
Process alpha channel, by default alpha channel is untouched.</p>
<p>charenc
Set subtitles input character encoding. subtitles filter only. Only useful if not UTF-8.</p>
<p>stream_index, si
Set subtitles stream index. subtitles filter only.</p>
<p>force_style
Override default style or script info parameters of the subtitles. It accepts a string containing ASS style format KEY=VALUE couples separated by “,”.</p>
<p>If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value specifies the filename.</p>
<p>For example, to render the file sub.srt on top of the input video, use the command:</p>
<p>subtitles=sub.srt
which is equivalent to:</p>
<p>subtitles=filename=sub.srt
To render the default subtitles stream from file video.mkv, use:</p>
<p>subtitles=video.mkv
To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:</p>
<p>subtitles=video.mkv:si=1
To make the subtitles stream from sub.srt appear in 80% transparent blue DejaVu Serif, use:</p>
<p>subtitles=sub.srt:force_style=’FontName=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&amp;HCCFF0000’
10.187 super2xsai
Scale the input by 2x and smooth using the Super2xSaI (Scale and Interpolate) pixel art scaling algorithm.</p>
<p>Useful for enlarging pixel art images without reducing sharpness.</p>

Set 2nd rect y coordinate.</p>
<p>All expressions are evaluated once for each frame.</p>
<p>The all options are expressions containing the following constants:</p>
<p>w
h
The input width and height.</p>
<p>a
same as w / h</p>
<p>sar
input sample aspect ratio</p>
<p>dar
input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar</p>

<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>first_field
‘top, t’
top field first</p>
<p>‘bottom, b’
bottom field first The default value is top.</p>
<p>pattern

16.67p: 33
16p: 33333334
10.191 threshold
Apply threshold effect to video stream.</p>
<p>This filter needs four video streams to perform thresholding. First stream is stream we are filtering. Second stream is holding threshold values, third stream is holding min values, and last, fourth stream is holding max values.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following option:</p>
<p>planes
Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied. By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.</p>
<p>For example if first stream pixel’s component value is less then threshold value of pixel component from 2nd threshold stream, third stream value will picked, otherwise fourth stream pixel component value will be picked.</p>
<p>Using color source filter one can perform various types of thresholding:</p>
<p>10.191.1 Examples
Binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=black -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi
Inverted binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -f lavfi -i color=black -lavfi threshold output.avi
Truncate binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:
ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -lavfi threshold output.avi
Threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:
ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -i 320x240.avi -lavfi threshold output.avi
Inverted threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:
ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi
10.192 thumbnail
Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive frames.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>n
Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of n frames, the filter will pick one of them, and then handle the next batch of n frames until the end. Default is 100.</p>
<p>Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger n value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.</p>
<p>10.192.1 Examples
Extract one picture each 50 frames:
thumbnail=50
Complete example of a thumbnail creation with ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png
10.193 tile
Tile several successive frames together.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>layout
Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>nb_frames
Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It must be less than or equal to wxh. The default value is 0, meaning all the area will be used.</p>
<p>margin
Set the outer border margin in pixels.</p>
<p>padding
Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between frames). For more advanced padding options (such as having different values for the edges), refer to the pad video filter.</p>
<p>color
Specify the color of the unused area. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value of color is “black”.</p>
<p>overlap
Set the number of frames to overlap when tiling several successive frames together. The value must be between 0 and nb_frames - 1.</p>
<p>init_padding
Set the number of frames to initially be empty before displaying first output frame. This controls how soon will one get first output frame. The value must be between 0 and nb_frames - 1.</p>
<p>10.193.1 Examples
Produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (-skip_frame nokey) in a movie:
ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf ‘scale=128:72,tile=8x8’ -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png
The -vsync 0 is necessary to prevent ffmpeg from duplicating each output frame to accommodate the originally detected frame rate.</p>
<p>Display 5 pictures in an area of 3x2 frames, with 7 pixels between them, and 2 pixels of initial margin, using mixed flat and named options:
tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2
10.194 tinterlace
Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.</p>
<p>Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is considered odd.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>mode
Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also be specified as a value alone. See below for a list of values for this option.</p>
<p>Available values are:</p>
<p>‘merge, 0’
Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field, generating a double height frame at half frame rate.</p>

Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>Default mode is merge.</p>
<p>flags
Specify flags influencing the filter process.</p>
<p>Available value for flags is:</p>
<p>low_pass_filter, vlfp
Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter. Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire patterning.</p>
<p>complex_filter, cvlfp
Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering. This will slightly less reduce interlace ’twitter’ and Moire patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression.</p>
<p>Vertical low-pass filtering can only be enabled for mode interleave_top and interleave_bottom.</p>
<p>10.195 tmix
Mix successive video frames.</p>
<p>A description of the accepted options follows.</p>
<p>frames
The number of successive frames to mix. If unspecified, it defaults to 3.</p>
<p>weights
Specify weight of each input video frame. Each weight is separated by space. If number of weights is smaller than number of frames last specified weight will be used for all remaining unset weights.</p>
<p>scale
Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with sum of each weight multiplied with pixel values to give final destination pixel value. By default scale is auto scaled to sum of weights.</p>
<p>10.195.1 Examples
Average 7 successive frames:
tmix=frames=7:weights=”1 1 1 1 1 1 1”
Apply simple temporal convolution:
tmix=frames=3:weights=”-1 3 -1”
Similar as above but only showing temporal differences:
tmix=frames=3:weights=”-1 2 -1”:scale=1
10.196 tonemap
Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.</p>
<p>This filter expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to operate on (and can output) out-of-range values. Another filter, such as zscale, is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable format.</p>
<p>The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so input data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,tonemap=clip,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT
10.196.1 Options
The filter accepts the following options.</p>
<p>tonemap
Set the tone map algorithm to use.</p>
<p>Possible values are:</p>
<p>none
Do not apply any tone map, only desaturate overbright pixels.</p>
<p>clip
Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use it for perfect color accuracy for in-range values, while distorting out-of-range values.</p>
<p>linear
Stretch the entire reference gamut to a linear multiple of the display.</p>
<p>gamma
Fit a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.</p>
<p>reinhard
Preserve overall image brightness with a simple curve, using nonlinear contrast, which results in flattening details and degrading color accuracy.</p>
<p>hable
Preserve both dark and bright details better than reinhard, at the cost of slightly darkening everything. Use it when detail preservation is more important than color and brightness accuracy.</p>
<p>mobius
Smoothly map out-of-range values, while retaining contrast and colors for in-range material as much as possible. Use it when color accuracy is more important than detail preservation.</p>
<p>Default is none.</p>
<p>param
Tune the tone mapping algorithm.</p>
<p>This affects the following algorithms:</p>
<p>none
Ignored.</p>
<p>linear
Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching. Default to 1.0.</p>
<p>gamma
Specifies the exponent of the function. Default to 1.8.</p>
<p>clip
Specify an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clipping. Default to 1.0.</p>
<p>reinhard
Specify the local contrast coefficient at the display peak. Default to 0.5, which means that in-gamut values will be about half as bright as when clipping.</p>
<p>hable
Ignored.</p>
<p>mobius
Specify the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value below this point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the more accurate the result will be, at the cost of losing bright details. Default to 0.3, which due to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range colors fairly accurately.</p>
<p>desat
Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by (smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural, at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.</p>
<p>The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will mostly just apply to skies or directly sunlit surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.</p>
<p>This option works only if the input frame has a supported color tag.</p>
<p>peak
Override signal/nominal/reference peak with this value. Useful when the embedded peak information in display metadata is not reliable or when tone mapping from a lower range to a higher range.</p>
<p>10.197 tpad
Temporarily pad video frames.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>start
Specify number of delay frames before input video stream.</p>
<p>stop
Specify number of padding frames after input video stream. Set to -1 to pad indefinitely.</p>
<p>start_mode
Set kind of frames added to beginning of stream. Can be either add or clone. With add frames of solid-color are added. With clone frames are clones of first frame.</p>
<p>stop_mode
Set kind of frames added to end of stream. Can be either add or clone. With add frames of solid-color are added. With clone frames are clones of last frame.</p>
<p>start_duration, stop_duration
Specify the duration of the start/stop delay. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax. These options override start and stop.</p>
<p>color
Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>The default value of color is “black”.</p>
<p>10.198 transpose
Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>dir
Specify the transposition direction.</p>
<p>Can assume the following values:</p>
<p>‘0, 4, cclock_flip’
Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip (default), that is:</p>
<p>L.R     L.l
. . -&gt;  . .
l.r     R.r
‘1, 5, clock’
Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, that is:</p>
<p>L.R     l.L
. . -&gt;  . .
l.r     r.R
‘2, 6, cclock’
Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:</p>
<p>L.R     R.r
. . -&gt;  . .
l.r     L.l
‘3, 7, clock_flip’
Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:</p>
<p>L.R     r.R
. . -&gt;  . .
l.r     l.L
For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are deprecated, the passthrough option should be used instead.</p>
<p>Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of symbolic constants.</p>
<p>passthrough
Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘none’
Always apply transposition.</p>
<p>‘portrait’
Preserve portrait geometry (when height &gt;= width).</p>
<p>‘landscape’
Preserve landscape geometry (when width &gt;= height).</p>
<p>Default value is none.</p>
<p>For example to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and preserve portrait layout:</p>
<p>transpose=dir=1:passthrough=portrait
The command above can also be specified as:</p>
<p>transpose=1:portrait
10.199 transpose_npp
Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it. For more in depth examples see the transpose video filter, which shares mostly the same options.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>dir
Specify the transposition direction.</p>
<p>Can assume the following values:</p>
<p>‘cclock_flip’
Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip. (default)</p>
<p>‘clock’
Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.</p>
<p>‘cclock’
Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.</p>
<p>‘clock_flip’
Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip.</p>
<p>passthrough
Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘none’
Always apply transposition. (default)</p>
<p>‘portrait’
Preserve portrait geometry (when height &gt;= width).</p>
<p>‘landscape’
Preserve landscape geometry (when width &gt;= height).</p>
<p>10.200 trim
Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>start
Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the timestamp start will be the first frame in the output.</p>
<p>end
Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame immediately preceding the one with the timestamp end will be the last frame in the output.</p>
<p>start_pts
This is the same as start, except this option sets the start timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.</p>
<p>end_pts
This is the same as end, except this option sets the end timestamp in timebase units instead of seconds.</p>
<p>duration
The maximum duration of the output in seconds.</p>
<p>start_frame
The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.</p>
<p>end_frame
The number of the first frame that should be dropped.</p>
<p>start, end, and duration are expressed as time duration specifications; see (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax.</p>
<p>Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the duration option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a setpts filter after the trim filter.</p>
<p>If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim filters.</p>
<p>The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g. just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Drop everything except the second minute of input:
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120
Keep only the first second:
ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1
10.201 unpremultiply
Apply alpha unpremultiply effect to input video stream using first plane of second stream as alpha.</p>
<p>Both streams must have same dimensions and same pixel format.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following option:</p>
<p>planes
Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied. By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.</p>
<p>If the format has 1 or 2 components, then luma is bit 0. If the format has 3 or 4 components: for RGB formats bit 0 is green, bit 1 is blue and bit 2 is red; for YUV formats bit 0 is luma, bit 1 is chroma-U and bit 2 is chroma-V. If present, the alpha channel is always the last bit.</p>
<p>inplace
Do not require 2nd input for processing, instead use alpha plane from input stream.</p>
<p>10.202 unsharp
Sharpen or blur the input video.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>luma_msize_x, lx
Set the luma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.</p>
<p>luma_msize_y, ly
Set the luma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.</p>
<p>luma_amount, la
Set the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.</p>
<p>Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.</p>
<p>Default value is 1.0.</p>
<p>chroma_msize_x, cx
Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.</p>
<p>chroma_msize_y, cy
Set the chroma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is 5.</p>
<p>chroma_amount, ca
Set the chroma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.</p>
<p>Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.</p>
<p>Default value is 0.0.</p>
<p>All parameters are optional and default to the equivalent of the string ’5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0’.</p>
<p>10.202.1 Examples
Apply strong luma sharpen effect:
unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=2.5
Apply a strong blur of both luma and chroma parameters:
unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2
10.203 uspp
Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the image at several (or - in the case of quality level 8 - all) shifts and average the results.</p>
<p>The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes &amp; decodes each case with libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>quality
Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the range 0-8. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 8 means the higher quality. For each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2. Default value is 3.</p>
<p>qp
Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).</p>
<p>10.204 vaguedenoiser
Apply a wavelet based denoiser.</p>
<p>It transforms each frame from the video input into the wavelet domain, using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau 9/7. Then it applies some filtering to the obtained coefficients. It does an inverse wavelet transform after. Due to wavelet properties, it should give a nice smoothed result, and reduced noise, without blurring picture features.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>threshold
The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be. Hard thresholding can use a higher threshold than soft thresholding before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.</p>
<p>method
The filtering method the filter will use.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘hard’
All values under the threshold will be zeroed.</p>
<p>‘soft’
All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be reduced by the threshold.</p>
<p>‘garrote’
Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and (less) hard thresholding.</p>
<p>Default is garrote.</p>
<p>nsteps
Number of times, the wavelet will decompose the picture. Picture can’t be decomposed beyond a particular point (typically, 8 for a 640x480 frame - as 2^9 = 512 &gt; 480). Valid values are integers between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.</p>
<p>percent
Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.</p>
<p>planes
A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.</p>
<p>10.205 vectorscope
Display 2 color component values in the two dimensional graph (which is called a vectorscope).</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>mode, m
Set vectorscope mode.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘gray’
Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have same component color value on location in graph. This is the default mode.</p>
<p>‘color’
Gray values are displayed on graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not present in video frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are set by option x and y. The 3rd color component is static.</p>
<p>‘color2’
Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph.</p>
<p>‘color3’
Similar as color2 but higher frequency of same values x and y on graph increases value of another color component, which is luminance by default values of x and y.</p>
<p>‘color4’
Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different colors map to same position on graph then color with higher value of component not present in graph is picked.</p>
<p>‘color5’
Gray values are displayed on graph. Similar to color but with 3rd color component picked from radial gradient.</p>
<p>x
Set which color component will be represented on X-axis. Default is 1.</p>
<p>y
Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis. Default is 2.</p>
<p>intensity, i
Set intensity, used by modes: gray, color, color3 and color5 for increasing brightness of color component which represents frequency of (X, Y) location in graph.</p>
<p>envelope, e
‘none’
No envelope, this is default.</p>
<p>‘instant’
Instant envelope, even darkest single pixel will be clearly highlighted.</p>
<p>‘peak’
Hold maximum and minimum values presented in graph over time. This way you can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at vectorscope.</p>
<p>‘peak+instant’
Peak and instant envelope combined together.</p>
<p>graticule, g
Set what kind of graticule to draw.</p>
<p>‘none’
‘green’
‘color’
opacity, o
Set graticule opacity.</p>
<p>flags, f
Set graticule flags.</p>
<p>‘white’
Draw graticule for white point.</p>
<p>‘black’
Draw graticule for black point.</p>
<p>‘name’
Draw color points short names.</p>
<p>bgopacity, b
Set background opacity.</p>
<p>lthreshold, l
Set low threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis. Values lower than this value will be ignored. Default is 0. Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and low threshold value of 0.1 actual threshold is 0.1 * 255 = 25.</p>
<p>hthreshold, h
Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis. Values higher than this value will be ignored. Default is 1. Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold is 0.9 * 255 = 230.</p>
<p>colorspace, c
Set what kind of colorspace to use when drawing graticule.</p>
<p>‘auto’
‘601’
‘709’
Default is auto.</p>
<p>10.206 vidstabdetect
Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see vidstabtransform for pass 2.</p>
<p>This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation transform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by the vidstabtransform filter.</p>
<p>To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with –enable-libvidstab.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>result
Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information. Default value is transforms.trf.</p>
<p>shakiness
Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.</p>
<p>accuracy
Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15.</p>
<p>stepsize
Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.</p>
<p>mincontrast
Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3.</p>
<p>tripod
Set reference frame number for tripod mode.</p>
<p>If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep the camera view absolutely still.</p>
<p>If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.</p>
<p>show
Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any visualization.</p>
<p>10.206.1 Examples
Use default values:
vidstabdetect
Analyze strongly shaky movie and put the results in file mytransforms.trf:
vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result=”mytransforms.trf”
Visualize the result of internal transformations in the resulting video:
vidstabdetect=show=1
Analyze a video with medium shakiness using ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i input -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=5:show=1 dummy.avi
10.207 vidstabtransform
Video stabilization/deshaking: pass 2 of 2, see vidstabdetect for pass 1.</p>
<p>Read a file with transform information for each frame and apply/compensate them. Together with the vidstabdetect filter this can be used to deshake videos. See also <a class="reference external" href="http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab">http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab</a>. It is important to also use the unsharp filter, see below.</p>
<p>To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with –enable-libvidstab.</p>
<p>10.207.1 Options
input
Set path to the file used to read the transforms. Default value is transforms.trf.</p>
<p>smoothing
Set the number of frames (value*2 + 1) used for lowpass filtering the camera movements. Default value is 10.</p>
<p>For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are used (10 in the past and 10 in the future) to smoothen the motion in the video. A larger value leads to a smoother video, but limits the acceleration of the camera (pan/tilt movements). 0 is a special case where a static camera is simulated.</p>
<p>optalgo
Set the camera path optimization algorithm.</p>
<p>Accepted values are:</p>
<p>‘gauss’
gaussian kernel low-pass filter on camera motion (default)</p>
<p>‘avg’
averaging on transformations</p>
<p>maxshift
Set maximal number of pixels to translate frames. Default value is -1, meaning no limit.</p>
<p>maxangle
Set maximal angle in radians (degree*PI/180) to rotate frames. Default value is -1, meaning no limit.</p>
<p>crop
Specify how to deal with borders that may be visible due to movement compensation.</p>
<p>Available values are:</p>
<p>‘keep’
keep image information from previous frame (default)</p>
<p>‘black’
fill the border black</p>
<p>invert
Invert transforms if set to 1. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>relative
Consider transforms as relative to previous frame if set to 1, absolute if set to 0. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>zoom
Set percentage to zoom. A positive value will result in a zoom-in effect, a negative value in a zoom-out effect. Default value is 0 (no zoom).</p>
<p>optzoom
Set optimal zooming to avoid borders.</p>
<p>Accepted values are:</p>
<p>‘0’
disabled</p>
<p>‘1’
optimal static zoom value is determined (only very strong movements will lead to visible borders) (default)</p>
<p>‘2’
optimal adaptive zoom value is determined (no borders will be visible), see zoomspeed</p>
<p>Note that the value given at zoom is added to the one calculated here.</p>
<p>zoomspeed
Set percent to zoom maximally each frame (enabled when optzoom is set to 2). Range is from 0 to 5, default value is 0.25.</p>
<p>interpol
Specify type of interpolation.</p>
<p>Available values are:</p>
<p>‘no’
no interpolation</p>
<p>‘linear’
linear only horizontal</p>
<p>‘bilinear’
linear in both directions (default)</p>
<p>‘bicubic’
cubic in both directions (slow)</p>
<p>tripod
Enable virtual tripod mode if set to 1, which is equivalent to relative=0:smoothing=0. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>Use also tripod option of vidstabdetect.</p>
<p>debug
Increase log verbosity if set to 1. Also the detected global motions are written to the temporary file global_motions.trf. Default value is 0.</p>

Use ffmpeg for a typical stabilization with default values:
ffmpeg -i inp.mpeg -vf vidstabtransform,unsharp=5:5:0.8:3:3:0.4 inp_stabilized.mpeg
Note the use of the unsharp filter which is always recommended.</p>
<p>Zoom in a bit more and load transform data from a given file:
vidstabtransform=zoom=5:input=”mytransforms.trf”
Smoothen the video even more:
vidstabtransform=smoothing=30
10.208 vflip
Flip the input video vertically.</p>
<p>For example, to vertically flip a video with ffmpeg:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf “vflip” out.avi
10.209 vfrdet
Detect variable frame rate video.</p>
<p>This filter tries to detect if the input is variable or constant frame rate.</p>
<p>At end it will output number of frames detected as having variable delta pts, and ones with constant delta pts. If there was frames with variable delta, than it will also show min and max delta encountered.</p>
<p>10.210 vibrance
Boost or alter saturation.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>intensity
Set strength of boost if positive value or strength of alter if negative value. Default is 0. Allowed range is from -2 to 2.</p>
<p>rbal
Set the red balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from -10 to 10.</p>
<p>gbal
Set the green balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from -10 to 10.</p>
<p>bbal
Set the blue balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from -10 to 10.</p>
<p>rlum
Set the red luma coefficient.</p>
<p>glum
Set the green luma coefficient.</p>
<p>blum
Set the blue luma coefficient.</p>
<p>alternate
If intensity is negative and this is set to 1, colors will change, otherwise colors will be less saturated, more towards gray.</p>
<p>10.211 vignette
Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>angle, a
Set lens angle expression as a number of radians.</p>
<p>The value is clipped in the [0,PI/2] range.</p>
<p>Default value: “PI/5”</p>
<p>x0
y0
Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively “w/2” and “h/2” by default.</p>
<p>mode
Set forward/backward mode.</p>
<p>Available modes are:</p>
<p>‘forward’
The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes.</p>
<p>‘backward’
The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes. This can be used to reverse a vignette effect, though there is no automatic detection to extract the lens angle and other settings (yet). It can also be used to create a burning effect.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘forward’.</p>
<p>eval
Set evaluation mode for the expressions (angle, x0, y0).</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘init’
Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization.</p>
<p>‘frame’
Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is way slower than the ‘init’ mode since it requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it allows advanced dynamic expressions.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘init’.</p>
<p>dither
Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is 1 (enabled).</p>
<p>aspect
Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette. Setting this value to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting following the dimensions of the video.</p>
<p>Default is 1/1.</p>
<p>10.211.1 Expressions
The alpha, x0 and y0 expressions can contain the following parameters.</p>
<p>w
h
input width and height</p>
<p>n

<p>t
the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame, expressed in seconds, NAN if undefined</p>
<p>tb
time base of the input video</p>
<p>10.211.2 Examples

vignette=PI/4
Make a flickering vignetting:
vignette=’PI/4+random(1)*PI/50’:eval=frame
10.212 vmafmotion
Obtain the average vmaf motion score of a video. It is one of the component filters of VMAF.</p>

<p>ffmpeg -i ref.mpg -lavfi vmafmotion -f null -
10.213 vstack
Stack input videos vertically.</p>
<p>All streams must be of same pixel format and of same width.</p>
<p>Note that this filter is faster than using overlay and pad filter to create same output.</p>
<p>The filter accept the following option:</p>
<p>inputs
Set number of input streams. Default is 2.</p>
<p>shortest
If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>10.214 w3fdif
Deinterlace the input video (“w3fdif” stands for “Weston 3 Field Deinterlacing Filter”).</p>
<p>Based on the process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&amp;D, and implemented based on the de-interlace algorithm written by Jim Easterbrook for BBC R&amp;D, the Weston 3 field deinterlacing filter uses filter coefficients calculated by BBC R&amp;D.</p>
<p>This filter use field-dominance information in frame to decide which of each pair of fields to place first in the output. If it gets it wrong use setfield filter before w3fdif filter.</p>
<p>There are two sets of filter coefficients, so called “simple”: and “complex”. Which set of filter coefficients is used can be set by passing an optional parameter:</p>
<p>filter
Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values:</p>
<p>‘simple’
Simple filter coefficient set.</p>
<p>‘complex’
More-complex filter coefficient set.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘complex’.</p>
<p>deint
Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accept one of the following values:</p>
<p>‘all’
Deinterlace all frames,</p>
<p>‘interlaced’
Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.</p>
<p>Default value is ‘all’.</p>
<p>10.215 waveform
Video waveform monitor.</p>
<p>The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luminance only. Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the source video.</p>
<p>It accepts the following options:</p>
<p>mode, m
Can be either row, or column. Default is column. In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.</p>
<p>intensity, i
Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same luminance are distributed across input rows/columns. Default value is 0.04. Allowed range is [0, 1].</p>
<p>mirror, r
Set mirroring mode. 0 means unmirrored, 1 means mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left side for row mode and at the top for column mode. Default is 1 (mirrored).</p>
<p>display, d
Set display mode. It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘overlay’
Presents information identical to that in the parade, except that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly over one another.</p>
<p>This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks.</p>
<p>‘stack’
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in row mode or one below the other in column mode.</p>
<p>‘parade’
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in column mode or one below the other in row mode.</p>
<p>Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms.</p>
<p>Default is stack.</p>
<p>components, c
Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luminance or red color component if input is in RGB colorspace. If is set for example to 7 it will display all 3 (if) available color components.</p>
<p>envelope, e
‘none’
No envelope, this is default.</p>
<p>‘instant’
Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in graph will be easily visible even with small step value.</p>
<p>‘peak’
Hold minimum and maximum values presented in graph across time. This way you can still spot out of range values without constantly looking at waveforms.</p>
<p>‘peak+instant’
Peak and instant envelope combined together.</p>
<p>filter, f
‘lowpass’
No filtering, this is default.</p>
<p>‘flat’
Luma and chroma combined together.</p>
<p>‘aflat’
Similar as above, but shows difference between blue and red chroma.</p>
<p>‘xflat’
Similar as above, but use different colors.</p>
<p>‘chroma’
Displays only chroma.</p>
<p>‘color’
Displays actual color value on waveform.</p>
<p>‘acolor’
Similar as above, but with luma showing frequency of chroma values.</p>

<p>scale, s
Set scale used for displaying graticule.</p>
<p>‘digital’
‘millivolts’
‘ire’
Default is digital.</p>
<p>bgopacity, b
Set background opacity.</p>

<p>The filter accept the following option:</p>
<p>inputs
Set number of input streams. Default is 2.</p>
<p>layout
Specify layout of inputs. This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user. This sets position of each video input in output. Each input is separated by ’|’. The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row. Numbers start at 0 and are separated by ’_’. Optionally one can use wX and hX, where X is video input from which to take width or height. Multiple values can be used when separated by ’+’. In such case values are summed together.</p>
<p>For 2 inputs, a default layout of 0_0|w0_0 is set. In all other cases, a layout must be set by the user.</p>
<p>shortest
If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.</p>

10.223 zscale
Scale (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg">https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg</a>. To enable compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with –enable-libzimg.</p>
<p>The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same as the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If the input image format is different from the format requested by the next filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the requested format.</p>
<p>10.223.1 Options
The filter accepts the following options.</p>
<p>width, w
height, h
Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension.</p>
<p>If the width or w value is 0, the input width is used for the output. If the height or h value is 0, the input height is used for the output.</p>
<p>If one and only one of the values is -n with n &gt;= 1, the zscale filter will use a value that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image, calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it will, however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and adjust the value if necessary.</p>
<p>If both values are -n with n &gt;= 1, the behavior will be identical to both values being set to 0 as previously detailed.</p>
<p>See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension expression.</p>

<p>11 OpenCL Video Filters
Below is a description of the currently available OpenCL video filters.</p>
<p>To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with –enable-opencl.</p>
<p>Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter graph.</p>
<p>-init_hw_device opencl[=name][:device[,key=value…]]
Initialise a new hardware device of type opencl called name, using the given device parameters.</p>
<p>-filter_hw_device name
Pass the hardware device called name to all filters in any filter graph.</p>
<p>For more detailed information see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options">https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options</a></p>
<p>Example of choosing the first device on the second platform and running avgblur_opencl filter with default parameters on it.
-init_hw_device opencl=gpu:1.0 -filter_hw_device gpu -i INPUT -vf “hwupload, avgblur_opencl, hwdownload” OUTPUT
Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded(hwupload) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded(hwdownload) back to normal memory. Note that hwupload will upload to a surface with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a format filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and hwdownload does not support all formats on the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional format filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.</p>
<p>11.1 avgblur_opencl
Apply average blur filter.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>sizeX
Set horizontal radius size. Range is [1, 1024] and default value is 1.</p>
<p>planes
Set which planes to filter. Default value is 0xf, by which all planes are processed.</p>
<p>sizeY
Set vertical radius size. Range is [1, 1024] and default value is 0. If zero, sizeX value will be used.</p>
<p>11.1.1 Example
Apply average blur filter with horizontal and vertical size of 3, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of the 7x7 region centered on it in the input. For pixels on the edges of the image, the region does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.
-i INPUT -vf “hwupload, avgblur_opencl=3, hwdownload” OUTPUT
11.2 boxblur_opencl
Apply a boxblur algorithm to the input video.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>luma_radius, lr
luma_power, lp
chroma_radius, cr
chroma_power, cp
alpha_radius, ar
alpha_power, ap
A description of the accepted options follows.</p>
<p>luma_radius, lr
chroma_radius, cr
alpha_radius, ar
Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for blurring the corresponding input plane.</p>
<p>The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must not be greater than the value of the expression min(w,h)/2 for the luma and alpha planes, and of min(cw,ch)/2 for the chroma planes.</p>
<p>Default value for luma_radius is “2”. If not specified, chroma_radius and alpha_radius default to the corresponding value set for luma_radius.</p>
<p>The expressions can contain the following constants:</p>
<p>w
h
The input width and height in pixels.</p>
<p>cw
ch
The input chroma image width and height in pixels.</p>
<p>hsub

<p>11.2.1 Examples
Apply boxblur filter, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of box-radiuses luma_radius, chroma_radius, alpha_radius for each plane respectively. The filter will apply luma_power, chroma_power, alpha_power times onto the corresponding plane. For pixels on the edges of the image, the radius does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.</p>
<p>Apply a boxblur filter with the luma, chroma, and alpha radius set to 2 and luma, chroma, and alpha power set to 3. The filter will run 3 times with box-radius set to 2 for every plane of the image.

12 Video Sources
Below is a description of the currently available video sources.</p>
<p>12.1 buffer
Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.</p>
<p>This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular through the interface defined in libavfilter/vsrc_buffer.h.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>video_size
Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>width
The input video width.</p>
<p>height
The input video height.</p>
<p>pix_fmt
A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames. It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format name.</p>
<p>time_base
Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.</p>
<p>frame_rate
Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.</p>
<p>pixel_aspect, sar
The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.</p>
<p>sws_param
Specify the optional parameters to be used for the scale filter which is automatically inserted when an input change is detected in the input size or format.</p>
<p>hw_frames_ctx
When using a hardware pixel format, this should be a reference to an AVHWFramesContext describing input frames.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1
will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and with format “yuv410p”, assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio). Since the pixel format with name “yuv410p” corresponds to the number 6 (check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in libavutil/pixfmt.h), this example corresponds to:</p>
<p>buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1
Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this syntax is deprecated:</p>
<p>width:height:pix_fmt:time_base.num:time_base.den:pixel_aspect.num:pixel_aspect.den[:sws_param]</p>
<p>12.2 cellauto
Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.</p>
<p>The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the filename and pattern options. If such options are not specified an initial state is created randomly.</p>
<p>At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole frame is filled is defined by the scroll option.</p>
<p>This source accepts the following options:</p>
<p>filename, f
Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from the specified file. In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the file will be ignored.</p>
<p>pattern, p
Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from the specified string.</p>
<p>Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the string will be ignored.</p>
<p>rate, r
Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second. Default is 25.</p>
<p>random_fill_ratio, ratio
Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.</p>
<p>This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.</p>
<p>random_seed, seed
Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.</p>
<p>rule
Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to 255. Default value is 110.</p>
<p>size, s
Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>If filename or pattern is specified, the size is set by default to the width of the specified initial state row, and the height is set to width * PHI.</p>
<p>If size is set, it must contain the width of the specified pattern string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the larger row.</p>
<p>If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value defaults to “320x518” (used for a randomly generated initial state).</p>
<p>scroll
If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row will be written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled. Defaults to 1.</p>
<p>start_full, full
If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before outputting the first frame. This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.</p>
<p>stitch
If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges together. This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.</p>
<p>12.2.1 Examples
Read the initial state from pattern, and specify an output of size 200x400.
cellauto=f=pattern:s=200x400
Generate a random initial row with a width of 200 cells, with a fill ratio of 2/3:
cellauto=ratio=2/3:s=200x200
Create a pattern generated by rule 18 starting by a single alive cell centered on an initial row with width 100:
cellauto=p=&#64;:s=100x400:full=0:rule=18
Specify a more elaborated initial pattern:
cellauto=p=’&#64;&#64; &#64; &#64;&#64;’:s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

The size of the video to generate. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>framerate
The framerate of the generated video. It may be a string of the form num/den or a frame rate abbreviation.</p>
<p>filter_name
The name to the frei0r source to load. For more information regarding frei0r and how to set the parameters, read the frei0r section in the video filters documentation.</p>
<p>filter_params
A ’|’-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r source.</p>
<p>For example, to generate a frei0r partik0l source with size 200x200 and frame rate 10 which is overlaid on the overlay filter main input:</p>
<p>frei0r_src=size=200x200:framerate=10:filter_name=partik0l:filter_params=1234 [overlay]; [in][overlay] overlay
12.7 life
Generate a life pattern.</p>
<p>This source is based on a generalization of John Conway’s life game.</p>
<p>The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.</p>
<p>At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule, which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a cell stay alive or born. The rule option allows one to specify the rule to adopt.</p>
<p>This source accepts the following options:</p>
<p>filename, f
Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline is used to delimit the end of each row.</p>
<p>If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated randomly.</p>
<p>rate, r
Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second. Default is 25.</p>
<p>random_fill_ratio, ratio
Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI. It is ignored when a file is specified.</p>
<p>random_seed, seed
Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.</p>
<p>rule
Set the life rule.</p>
<p>A rule can be specified with a code of the kind “SNS/BNB”, where NS and NB are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8, NS specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a live cell stay alive, and NB the number of alive neighbor cells which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to “born”). “s” and “b” can be used in place of “S” and “B”, respectively.</p>
<p>Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9 high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify the rule for “borning” new cells. Higher order bits encode for an higher number of neighbor cells. For example the number 6153 = (12&lt;&lt;9)+9 specifies a stay alive rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to “S23/B03”.</p>
<p>Default value is “S23/B3”, which is the original Conway’s game of life rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around a dead cell.</p>
<p>size, s
Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>If filename is specified, the size is set by default to the same size of the input file. If size is set, it must contain the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in that file is centered in the larger resulting area.</p>
<p>If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to “320x240” (used for a randomly generated initial grid).</p>
<p>stitch
If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.</p>
<p>mold
Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from death_color to mold_color with a step of mold. mold can have a value from 0 to 255.</p>
<p>life_color
Set the color of living (or new born) cells.</p>
<p>death_color
Set the color of dead cells. If mold is set, this is the first color used to represent a dead cell.</p>
<p>mold_color
Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.</p>
<p>For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>12.7.1 Examples
Read a grid from pattern, and center it on a grid of size 300x300 pixels:
life=f=pattern:s=300x300
Generate a random grid of size 200x200, with a fill ratio of 2/3:
life=ratio=2/3:s=200x200
Specify a custom rule for evolving a randomly generated grid:
life=rule=S14/B34
Full example with slow death effect (mold) using ffplay:
ffplay -f lavfi life=s=300x200:mold=10:r=60:ratio=0.1:death_color=#C83232:life_color=#00ff00,scale=1200:800:flags=16
12.8 allrgb, allyuv, color, haldclutsrc, nullsrc, pal75bars, pal100bars, rgbtestsrc, smptebars, smptehdbars, testsrc, testsrc2, yuvtestsrc
The allrgb source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of all rgb colors.</p>
<p>The allyuv source returns frames of size 4096x4096 of all yuv colors.</p>
<p>The color source provides an uniformly colored input.</p>
<p>The haldclutsrc source provides an identity Hald CLUT. See also haldclut filter.</p>
<p>The nullsrc source returns unprocessed video frames. It is mainly useful to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the source for filters which ignore the input data.</p>
<p>The pal75bars source generates a color bars pattern, based on EBU PAL recommendations with 75% color levels.</p>
<p>The pal100bars source generates a color bars pattern, based on EBU PAL recommendations with 100% color levels.</p>
<p>The rgbtestsrc source generates an RGB test pattern useful for detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a red, green and blue stripe from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The smptebars source generates a color bars pattern, based on the SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.</p>
<p>The smptehdbars source generates a color bars pattern, based on the SMPTE RP 219-2002.</p>
<p>The testsrc source generates a test video pattern, showing a color pattern, a scrolling gradient and a timestamp. This is mainly intended for testing purposes.</p>
<p>The testsrc2 source is similar to testsrc, but supports more pixel formats instead of just rgb24. This allows using it as an input for other tests without requiring a format conversion.</p>
<p>The yuvtestsrc source generates an YUV test pattern. You should see a y, cb and cr stripe from top to bottom.</p>
<p>The sources accept the following parameters:</p>
<p>level
Specify the level of the Hald CLUT, only available in the haldclutsrc source. A level of N generates a picture of N*N*N by N*N*N pixels to be used as identity matrix for 3D lookup tables. Each component is coded on a 1/(N*N) scale.</p>
<p>color, c
Specify the color of the source, only available in the color source. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Color” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.</p>
<p>size, s
Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value is 320x240.</p>
<p>This option is not available with the allrgb, allyuv, and haldclutsrc filters.</p>
<p>rate, r
Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames generated per second. It has to be a string in the format frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a floating point number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is “25”.</p>
<p>duration, d
Set the duration of the sourced video. See (ffmpeg-utils)the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual for the accepted syntax.</p>
<p>If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is supposed to be generated forever.</p>
<p>sar
Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.</p>
<p>alpha
Specify the alpha (opacity) of the background, only available in the testsrc2 source. The value must be between 0 (fully transparent) and 255 (fully opaque, the default).</p>
<p>decimals, n
Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only available in the testsrc source.</p>
<p>The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the original timestamp value multiplied by the power of 10 of the specified value. Default value is 0.</p>
<p>12.8.1 Examples
Generate a video with a duration of 5.3 seconds, with size 176x144 and a frame rate of 10 frames per second:
testsrc=duration=5.3:size=qcif:rate=10
The following graph description will generate a red source with an opacity of 0.2, with size “qcif” and a frame rate of 10 frames per second:
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:color=c=red&#37;&#52;&#48;0&#46;2">color=c=red<span>&#64;</span>0<span>&#46;</span>2</a>:s=qcif:r=10
If the input content is to be ignored, nullsrc can be used. The following command generates noise in the luminance plane by employing the geq filter:
nullsrc=s=256x256, geq=random(1)*255:128:128
12.8.2 Commands
The color source supports the following commands:</p>
<p>c, color
Set the color of the created image. Accepts the same syntax of the corresponding color option.</p>

<p>size, s
Size of frames to generate. This must be set.</p>
<p>format
Pixel format to use for the generated frames. This must be set.</p>
<p>rate, r
Number of frames generated every second. Default value is ’25’.</p>
<p>For details of how the program loading works, see the program_opencl filter.</p>
<p>Example programs:</p>
<p>Generate a colour ramp by setting pixel values from the position of the pixel in the output image. (Note that this will work with all pixel formats, but the generated output will not be the same.)
__kernel void ramp(__write_only image2d_t dst,</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>[a] avectorscope=zoom=1.3:rc=2:gc=200:bc=10:rf=1:gf=8:bf=7 [out0]’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>14.5 bench, abench
Benchmark part of a filtergraph.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>action
Start or stop a timer.</p>
<p>Available values are:</p>
<p>‘start’
Get the current time, set it as frame metadata (using the key lavfi.bench.start_time), and forward the frame to the next filter.</p>
<p>‘stop’
Get the current time and fetch the lavfi.bench.start_time metadata from the input frame metadata to get the time difference. Time difference, average, maximum and minimum time (respectively t, avg, max and min) are then printed. The timestamps are expressed in seconds.</p>
<p>14.5.1 Examples
Benchmark selectivecolor filter:
bench=start,selectivecolor=reds=-.2 .12 -.49,bench=stop
14.6 concat
Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the other.</p>
<p>The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will also be the number of streams at output.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>n
Set the number of segments. Default is 2.</p>
<p>v
Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video streams in each segment. Default is 1.</p>
<p>a
Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of audio streams in each segment. Default is 0.</p>
<p>unsafe
Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.</p>
<p>The filter has v+a outputs: first v video outputs, then a audio outputs.</p>
<p>There are nx(v+a) inputs: first the inputs for the first segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second segment, etc.</p>
<p>Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason, related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter audio streams with silence.</p>
<p>For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.</p>
<p>All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted explicitly by the user.</p>
<p>Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.</p>
<p>14.6.1 Examples
Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual version (video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):
ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex </p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>‘[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]</dt><dd><p>concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]’ </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>-map ‘[v]’ -map ‘[a1]’ -map ‘[a2]’ output.mkv</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the (a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:
movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
[v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]
Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video streams do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.</p>

Example using metadata from ebur128 filter:</p>
<p>ebur128=metadata=1,adrawgraph=lavfi.r128.M:min=-120:max=5
14.8 ebur128
EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream and analyzes its loudness level. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the Momentary loudness (identified by M), Short-term loudness (S), Integrated loudness (I) and Loudness Range (LRA).</p>
<p>The filter can only analyze streams which have a sampling rate of 48000 Hz and whose sample format is double-precision floating point. The input stream will be converted to this specification, if needed. Users may need to insert aformat and/or aresample filters after this filter to obtain the original parameters.</p>
<p>The filter also has a video output (see the video option) with a real time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set, unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured to instead display short-term loudness (see gauge).</p>
<p>The green area marks a +/- 1LU target range around the target loudness (-23LUFS by default, unless modified through target).</p>
<p>More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on <a class="reference external" href="http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness">http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness</a>.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>video
Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this option is set or no. The video stream will be the first output stream if activated. Default is 0.</p>
<p>size
Set the video size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default and minimum resolution is 640x480.</p>
<p>meter
Set the EBU scale meter. Default is 9. Common values are 9 and 18, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any other integer value between this range is allowed.</p>
<p>metadata
Set metadata injection. If set to 1, the audio input will be segmented into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information in metadata. All the metadata keys are prefixed with lavfi.r128..</p>
<p>Default is 0.</p>
<p>framelog
Force the frame logging level.</p>
<p>Available values are:</p>
<p>‘info’
information logging level</p>
<p>‘verbose’

<p>By default, the logging level is set to info. If the video or the metadata options are set, it switches to verbose.</p>
<p>peak
Set peak mode(s).</p>
<p>Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a flag type). Possible values are:</p>
<p>‘none’
Disable any peak mode (default).</p>
<p>‘sample’
Enable sample-peak mode.</p>
<p>Simple peak mode looking for the higher sample value. It logs a message for sample-peak (identified by SPK).</p>
<p>‘true’
Enable true-peak mode.</p>
<p>If enabled, the peak lookup is done on an over-sampled version of the input stream for better peak accuracy. It logs a message for true-peak. (identified by TPK) and true-peak per frame (identified by FTPK). This mode requires a build with libswresample.</p>
<p>dualmono
Treat mono input files as “dual mono”. If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system, its EBU R128 measurement will be perceptually incorrect. If set to true, this option will compensate for this effect. Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.</p>
<p>panlaw
Set a specific pan law to be used for the measurement of dual mono files. This parameter is optional, and has a default value of -3.01dB.</p>
<p>target
Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative zero in the visualization. This parameter is optional and has a default value of -23LUFS as specified by EBU R128. However, material published online may prefer a level of -16LUFS (e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).</p>
<p>gauge
Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are momentary and s shortterm. By default the momentary value will be used, but in certain scenarios it may be more useful to observe the short term value instead (e.g. live mixing).</p>
<p>scale
Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters are absolute (in LUFS) or relative (LU) relative to the target. This only affects the video output, not the summary or continuous log output.</p>
<p>14.8.1 Examples
Real-time graph using ffplay, with a EBU scale meter +18:
ffplay -f lavfi -i “amovie=input.mp3,ebur128=video=1:meter=18 [out0][out1]”
Run an analysis with ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -nostats -i input.mp3 -filter_complex ebur128 -f null -
14.9 interleave, ainterleave
Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.</p>
<p>interleave works with video inputs, ainterleave with audio.</p>
<p>These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest queued frame to the output.</p>
<p>Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame timestamp values.</p>
<p>In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.</p>
<p>For example consider the case when one input is a select filter which always drops input frames. The interleave filter will keep reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.</p>
<p>Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and the queue is already filled.</p>
<p>These filters accept the following options:</p>
<p>nb_inputs, n
Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.</p>
<p>14.9.1 Examples
Interleave frames belonging to different streams using ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i bambi.avi -i pr0n.mkv -filter_complex “[0:v][1:v] interleave” out.avi
Add flickering blur effect:
select=’if(gt(random(0), 0.2), 1, 2)’:n=2 [tmp], boxblur=2:2, [tmp] interleave
14.10 metadata, ametadata
Manipulate frame metadata.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>mode
Set mode of operation of the filter.</p>
<p>Can be one of the following:</p>
<p>‘select’
If both value and key is set, select frames which have such metadata. If only key is set, select every frame that has such key in metadata.</p>
<p>‘add’
Add new metadata key and value. If key is already available do nothing.</p>
<p>‘modify’
Modify value of already present key.</p>
<p>‘delete’
If value is set, delete only keys that have such value. Otherwise, delete key. If key is not set, delete all metadata values in the frame.</p>
<p>‘print’
Print key and its value if metadata was found. If key is not set print all metadata values available in frame.</p>
<p>key
Set key used with all modes. Must be set for all modes except print and delete.</p>
<p>value
Set metadata value which will be used. This option is mandatory for modify and add mode.</p>
<p>function
Which function to use when comparing metadata value and value.</p>
<p>Can be one of following:</p>
<p>‘same_str’
Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value is same as value.</p>
<p>‘starts_with’
Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value starts with the value option string.</p>
<p>‘less’
Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is less than value.</p>
<p>‘equal’
Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if value is equal with metadata value.</p>
<p>‘greater’
Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is greater than value.</p>
<p>‘expr’
Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if expression from option expr evaluates to true.</p>
<p>expr
Set expression which is used when function is set to expr. The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following constants:</p>
<p>VALUE1
Float representation of value from metadata key.</p>
<p>VALUE2
Float representation of value as supplied by user in value option.</p>
<p>file
If specified in print mode, output is written to the named file. Instead of plain filename any writable url can be specified. Filename “-” is a shorthand for standard output. If file option is not set, output is written to the log with AV_LOG_INFO loglevel.</p>
<p>14.10.1 Examples
Print all metadata values for frames with key lavfi.signalstats.YDIF with values between 0 and 1.
signalstats,metadata=print:key=lavfi.signalstats.YDIF:value=0:function=expr:expr=’between(VALUE1,0,1)’
Print silencedetect output to file metadata.txt.
silencedetect,ametadata=mode=print:file=metadata.txt
Direct all metadata to a pipe with file descriptor 4.
metadata=mode=print:file=’pipe:4’
14.11 perms, aperms
Set read/write permissions for the output frames.</p>
<p>These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct path in the following filter in the filtergraph.</p>
<p>The filters accept the following options:</p>
<p>mode
Select the permissions mode.</p>
<p>It accepts the following values:</p>
<p>‘none’
Do nothing. This is the default.</p>
<p>‘ro’
Set all the output frames read-only.</p>
<p>‘rw’
Set all the output frames directly writable.</p>
<p>‘toggle’
Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only.</p>
<p>‘random’
Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.</p>
<p>seed
Set the seed for the random mode, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.</p>
<p>Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the following one, the permission might not be received as expected in that following filter. Inserting a format or aformat filter before the perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.</p>
<p>14.12 realtime, arealtime
Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.</p>
<p>These filters will pause the filtering for a variable amount of time to match the output rate with the input timestamps. They are similar to the re option to ffmpeg.</p>
<p>They accept the following options:</p>
<p>limit
Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that will be considered a timestamp discontinuity and reset the timer. Default is 2 seconds.</p>
<p>speed
Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float larger than zero. Values larger than 1.0 will result in faster than realtime processing, smaller will slow processing down. The limit is automatically adapted accordingly. Default is 1.0.</p>
<p>A processing speed faster than what is possible without these filters cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>14.13 select, aselect
Select frames to pass in output.</p>
<p>This filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>expr, e
Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.</p>
<p>If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded.</p>
<p>If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index ceil(val)-1, assuming that the input index starts from 0.</p>
<p>For example a value of 1.2 corresponds to the output with index ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1, that is the second output.</p>
<p>outputs, n
Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.</p>
<p>The expression can contain the following constants:</p>
<p>n
The (sequential) number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.</p>
<p>selected_n
The (sequential) number of the selected frame, starting from 0.</p>
<p>prev_selected_n
The sequential number of the last selected frame. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>TB

<p>pts
The PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame, expressed in TB units. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>t
The PTS of the filtered video frame, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>prev_pts
The PTS of the previously filtered video frame. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>prev_selected_pts
The PTS of the last previously filtered video frame. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>prev_selected_t
The PTS of the last previously selected video frame, expressed in seconds. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>start_pts
The PTS of the first video frame in the video. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>start_t
The time of the first video frame in the video. It’s NAN if undefined.</p>
<p>pict_type (video only)
The type of the filtered frame. It can assume one of the following values:</p>
<p>I
P
B
S
SI
SP
BI
interlace_type (video only)
The frame interlace type. It can assume one of the following values:</p>
<p>PROGRESSIVE
The frame is progressive (not interlaced).</p>
<p>TOPFIRST
The frame is top-field-first.</p>
<p>BOTTOMFIRST
The frame is bottom-field-first.</p>
<p>consumed_sample_n (audio only)
the number of selected samples before the current frame</p>
<p>samples_n (audio only)
the number of samples in the current frame</p>
<p>sample_rate (audio only)
the input sample rate</p>
<p>key
This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>pos
the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information is not available (e.g. for synthetic video)</p>
<p>scene (video only)
value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see the example below)</p>
<p>concatdec_select
The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an inpoint and an outpoint, but the output packets may not be entirely contained in the selected interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip frames generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly contained in the selected interval.</p>
<p>This works by comparing the frame pts against the lavf.concat.start_time and the lavf.concat.duration packet metadata values which are also present in the decoded frames.</p>
<p>The concatdec_select variable is -1 if the frame pts is at least start_time and either the duration metadata is missing or the frame pts is less than start_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if the start_time metadata is missing.</p>
<p>That basically means that an input frame is selected if its pts is within the interval set by the concat demuxer.</p>
<p>The default value of the select expression is “1”.</p>
<p>14.13.1 Examples
Select all frames in input:
select
The example above is the same as:</p>
<p>select=1
Skip all frames:
select=0
Select only I-frames:
select=’eq(pict_type,I)’
Select one frame every 100:
select=’not(mod(n,100))’
Select only frames contained in the 10-20 time interval:
select=between(t,10,20)
Select only I-frames contained in the 10-20 time interval:
select=between(t,10,20)*eq(pict_type,I)
Select frames with a minimum distance of 10 seconds:
select=’isnan(prev_selected_t)+gte(t-prev_selected_t,10)’
Use aselect to select only audio frames with samples number &gt; 100:
aselect=’gt(samples_n,100)’
Create a mosaic of the first scenes:
ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select=’gt(scene,0.4)’,scale=160:120,tile -frames:v 1 preview.png
Comparing scene against a value between 0.3 and 0.5 is generally a sane choice.</p>
<p>Send even and odd frames to separate outputs, and compose them:
select=n=2:e=’mod(n, 2)+1’ [odd][even]; [odd] pad=h=2*ih [tmp]; [tmp][even] overlay=y=h
Select useful frames from an ffconcat file which is using inpoints and outpoints but where the source files are not intra frame only.
ffmpeg -copyts -vsync 0 -segment_time_metadata 1 -i input.ffconcat -vf select=concatdec_select -af aselect=concatdec_select output.avi
14.14 sendcmd, asendcmd
Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.</p>
<p>These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the filtergraph.</p>
<p>sendcmd must be inserted between two video filters, asendcmd must be inserted between two audio filters, but apart from that they act the same way.</p>
<p>The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments with the commands option, or in a file specified by the filename option.</p>
<p>These filters accept the following options:</p>
<p>commands, c
Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.</p>
<p>filename, f
Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.</p>
<p>14.14.1 Commands syntax
A commands description consists of a sequence of interval specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time interval.</p>
<p>An interval is specified by the following syntax:</p>
<p>START[-END] COMMANDS;
The time interval is specified by the START and END times. END is optional and defaults to the maximum time.</p>
<p>The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if it is included in the interval [START, END), that is when the time is greater or equal to START and is lesser than END.</p>
<p>COMMANDS consists of a sequence of one or more command specifications, separated by “,”, relating to that interval. The syntax of a command specification is given by:</p>
<p>[FLAGS] TARGET COMMAND ARG
FLAGS is optional and specifies the type of events relating to the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by “+” or “|” and enclosed between “[” and “]”.</p>
<p>The following flags are recognized:</p>
<p>enter
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the current is.</p>
<p>leave
The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the current is not.</p>
<p>If FLAGS is not specified, a default value of [enter] is assumed.</p>
<p>TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the filter class or a specific filter instance name.</p>
<p>COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.</p>
<p>ARG is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for the given COMMAND.</p>
<p>Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or sequences of characters starting with # until the end of line, are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.</p>
<p>A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax follows:</p>
<p>COMMAND_FLAG  ::= “enter” | “leave”
COMMAND_FLAGS ::= COMMAND_FLAG [(+|”|”)COMMAND_FLAG]
COMMAND       ::= [“[” COMMAND_FLAGS “]”] TARGET COMMAND [ARG]
COMMANDS      ::= COMMAND [,COMMANDS]
INTERVAL      ::= START[-END] COMMANDS
INTERVALS     ::= INTERVAL[;INTERVALS]
14.14.2 Examples
Specify audio tempo change at second 4:
asendcmd=c=‘4.0 atempo tempo 1.5’,atempo
Target a specific filter instance:
asendcmd=c=‘4.0 <a class="reference external" href="mailto:atempo&#37;&#52;&#48;my">atempo<span>&#64;</span>my</a> tempo 1.5’,atempo&#64;my
Specify a list of drawtext and hue commands in a file.
# show text in the interval 5-10
5.0-10.0 [enter] drawtext reinit ‘fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=hello world’,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[leave] drawtext reinit ‘fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=’;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p># desaturate the image in the interval 15-20
15.0-20.0 [enter] hue s 0,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[enter] drawtext reinit ‘fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=nocolor’,
[leave] hue s 1,
[leave] drawtext reinit ‘fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=color’;</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p># apply an exponential saturation fade-out effect, starting from time 25
25 [enter] hue s exp(25-t)
A filtergraph allowing to read and process the above command list stored in a file test.cmd, can be specified with:</p>
<p>sendcmd=f=test.cmd,drawtext=fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=’‘,hue

14.18 showcqt
Convert input audio to a video output representing frequency spectrum logarithmically using Brown-Puckette constant Q transform algorithm with direct frequency domain coefficient calculation (but the transform itself is not really constant Q, instead the Q factor is actually variable/clamped), with musical tone scale, from E0 to D#10.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>size, s
Specify the video size for the output. It must be even. For the syntax of this option, check the (ffmpeg-utils)”Video size” section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default value is 1920x1080.</p>

<p>14.27 spectrumsynth
Sythesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents magnitude across time and second represents phase across time. The filter will transform from frequency domain as displayed in videos back to time domain as presented in audio output.</p>
<p>This filter is primarily created for reversing processed showspectrum filter outputs, but can synthesize sound from other spectrograms too. But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually it’s just recreated from random noise. For best results use gray only output (channel color mode in showspectrum filter) and log scale for magnitude video and lin scale for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use data option. Inputs videos should generally use fullframe slide mode as that saves resources needed for decoding video.</p>
<p>The filter accepts the following options:</p>
<p>sample_rate
Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which spectrum was generated may differ.</p>
<p>channels
Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.</p>
<p>scale
Set scale which was used when generating magnitude input spectrum. Can be lin or log. Default is log.</p>
<p>slide
Set slide which was used when generating inputs spectrums. Can be replace, scroll, fullframe or rscroll. Default is fullframe.</p>
<p>win_func
Set window function used for resynthesis.</p>
<p>overlap
Set window overlap. In range [0, 1]. Default is 1, which means optimal overlap for selected window function will be picked.</p>
<p>orientation
Set orientation of input videos. Can be vertical or horizontal. Default is vertical.</p>
<p>14.27.1 Examples
First create magnitude and phase videos from audio, assuming audio is stereo with 44100 sample rate, then resynthesize videos back to audio with spectrumsynth:
ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=log:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=magnitude -an -c:v rawvideo magnitude.nut
ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=lin:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=phase -an -c:v rawvideo phase.nut
ffmpeg -i magnitude.nut -i phase.nut -lavfi spectrumsynth=channels=2:sample_rate=44100:win_func=hann:overlap=0.875:slide=fullframe output.flac
14.28 split, asplit
Split input into several identical outputs.</p>
<p>asplit works with audio input, split with video.</p>
<p>The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.</p>
<p>14.28.1 Examples
Create two separate outputs from the same input:
[in] split [out0][out1]
To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of outputs, like in:
[in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]
Create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and one padded:
[in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
[splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
[splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];
Create 5 copies of the input audio with ffmpeg:
ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT
14.29 zmq, azmq
Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to filters in the filtergraph.</p>
<p>zmq and azmq work as a pass-through filters. zmq must be inserted between two video filters, azmq between two audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.</p>
<p>To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and headers and configure FFmpeg with –enable-libzmq.</p>
<p>For more information about libzmq see: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zeromq.org/">http://www.zeromq.org/</a></p>
<p>The zmq and azmq filters work as a libzmq server, which receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the bind_address (or the abbreviation “b”) option. Default value of this option is <a class="reference external" href="tcp://localhost:5555">tcp://localhost:5555</a>. You may want to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any ’:’ signs (see filtergraph escaping).</p>
<p>The received message must be in the form:</p>
<p>TARGET COMMAND [ARG]
TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the filter class or a specific filter instance name. The default filter instance name uses the pattern ‘Parsed_&lt;filter_name&gt;_&lt;index&gt;’, but you can override this by using the ‘<a class="reference external" href="mailto:filter_name&#37;&#52;&#48;id">filter_name<span>&#64;</span>id</a>’ syntax (see Filtergraph syntax).</p>
<p>COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.</p>
<p>ARG is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the given COMMAND.</p>
<p>Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:</p>
<p>ERROR_CODE ERROR_REASON
MESSAGE
MESSAGE is optional.</p>
<p>14.29.1 Examples
Look at tools/zmqsend for an example of a zmq client which can be used to send commands processed by these filters.</p>
<p>Consider the following filtergraph generated by ffplay. In this example the last overlay filter has an instance name. All other filters will have default instance names.</p>
<p>ffplay -dumpgraph 1 -f lavfi ”
color=s=100x100:c=red  [l];
color=s=100x100:c=blue [r];
nullsrc=s=200x100, zmq [bg];
[bg][l]   overlay     [bg+l];
[bg+l][r] <a class="reference external" href="mailto:overlay&#37;&#52;&#48;my=x=100">overlay<span>&#64;</span>my=x=100</a> ”
To change the color of the left side of the video, the following command can be used:</p>
<p>echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend
To change the right side:</p>
<p>echo Parsed_color_1 c pink | tools/zmqsend
To change the position of the right side:</p>
<p>echo <a class="reference external" href="mailto:overlay&#37;&#52;&#48;my">overlay<span>&#64;</span>my</a> x 150 | tools/zmqsend
15 Multimedia Sources
Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.</p>
<p>15.1 amovie
This is the same as movie source, except it selects an audio stream by default.</p>
<p>15.2 movie
Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.</p>
<p>It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<p>filename
The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a device or a stream accessed through some protocol).</p>
<p>format_name, f
Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the format is guessed from movie_name or by probing.</p>
<p>seek_point, sp
Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with av_strtod, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS postfix. The default value is “0”.</p>
<p>streams, s
Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified, separated by “+”. The source will then have as many outputs, in the same order. The syntax is explained in the (ffmpeg)”Stream specifiers” section in the ffmpeg manual. Two special names, “dv” and “da” specify respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default is “dv”, or “da” if the filter is called as “amovie”.</p>
<p>stream_index, si
Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1, the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default value is “-1”. Deprecated. If the filter is called “amovie”, it will select audio instead of video.</p>
<p>loop
Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence. If the value is 0, the stream will be looped infinitely. Default value is “1”.</p>
<p>Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.</p>
<p>discontinuity
Specifies the time difference between frames above which the point is considered a timestamp discontinuity which is removed by adjusting the later timestamps.</p>
<p>It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>input ———–&gt; deltapts0 –&gt; overlay –&gt; output</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>movie –&gt; scale–&gt; deltapts1 ——-+
15.2.1 Examples
Skip 3.2 seconds from the start of the AVI file in.avi, and overlay it on top of the input labelled “in”:
movie=in.avi:seek_point=3.2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
[in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
[main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]
Read from a video4linux2 device, and overlay it on top of the input labelled “in”:
movie=/dev/video0:f=video4linux2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
[in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
[main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]
Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from dvd.vob; the video is connected to the pad named “video” and the audio is connected to the pad named “audio”:
movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]
15.2.2 Commands
Both movie and amovie support the following commands:</p>
<p>seek
Perform seek using “av_seek_frame”. The syntax is: seek stream_index|timestamp|flags</p>
<p>stream_index: If stream_index is -1, a default stream is selected, and timestamp is automatically converted from AV_TIME_BASE units to the stream specific time_base.
timestamp: Timestamp in AVStream.time_base units or, if no stream is specified, in AV_TIME_BASE units.
flags: Flags which select direction and seeking mode.
get_duration
Get movie duration in AV_TIME_BASE units.</p>
