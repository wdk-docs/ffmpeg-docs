FFmpeg has always been a very experimental and developer-driven project.
It is a key component in many multimedia projects and has new features added constantly.
Development branch snapshots work really well 99% of the time so people are not afraid to use them.

Releases
------------------------

Approximately every 6 months the FFmpeg project makes a new major release. Between major releases point releases will appear that add important bug fixes but no new features. Note that these releases are intended for distributors and system integrators. Users that wish to compile from source themselves are strongly encouraged to consider using the development branch (see above), this is the only version on which FFmpeg developers actively work. The release branches only cherry pick selected changes from the development branch, which therefore receives much more and much faster bug fixes such as additional features and security patches.
