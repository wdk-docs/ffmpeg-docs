Mailing Lists
---------------------------

Please follow the netiquette when posting on FFmpeg mailing lists, especially avoid top-posting and thread hijacking (that is, replying to a thread and changing the subject line to something completely unrelated that was not being discussed within the original thread) and please read the Code of conduct.

Configuring your mail client to break lines after 70 or so characters is a plus. If you attach files, avoid compressing small files, uncompressed is preferred. Also please try to avoid posting mails with overly long signatures or nonsense corporate disclaimers that claim the content of your mails is confidential.

Attached patches should not have application/octet-stream as mime-type, but text/plain or even better text/x-diff or text/x-patch.
If you send us a patch, please make it some form of unified diff. We prefer patches made using git format-patch from the root of your FFmpeg checkout or sent with git send-email as shown in Using git to develop FFmpeg. For additional information and guidelines refer to the FFmpeg Developer Documentation.

Please read the Mailing List FAQ before sending a message.

ffmpeg-devel
For discussions involving development of FFmpeg. Patches for FFmpeg should be submitted here. Make sure you are subscribed so you will receive comments and reviews for your patches. It is not for development of software that use the FFmpeg libraries and not for bug reports unless you are submitting a patch that fixes the problem.
ffmpeg-user
For general user questions and discussions involving the FFmpeg cli tools: ffmpeg, ffplay, ffprobe, and ffserver.
libav-user
For questions about using the FFmpeg libraries and API.
ffmpeg-cvslog
A log of all changes and updates made to the FFmpeg source. No discussion occurs on this mailing list.
ffmpeg-trac
A log of all bug reports, comments, and status changes made on the bug tracker. No discussion occurs on this mailing list (other than what occurs directly within the bug tracker).

Archives

To read up on past discussions, read the mailing list archives. It is highly likely that you will find an answer to your questions there, so make sure to browse the archives before posting questions.

IRC Channels
---------------------------

FFmpeg has two official channels on the freenode IRC network. Both channels are open and unmoderated. Maintainers have operator status, contributors with patches in FFmpeg have voice in the channels. freenode webchat is a web client for these channels. Please read and follow the Code of conduct.

#ffmpeg
For user support and general questions similar to the ffmpeg-user mailing list
#ffmpeg-devel
Strictly dedicated to FFmpeg development. This means development of FFmpeg itself. Development of other software that uses the FFmpeg libraries is offtopic there.
 Archives
Our IRC channels are publically logged and archives of both channels can be viewed at ffmpeg-devel-irc.

Forums
---------------------------

FFmpeg offers no official forum. However, we collect links to FFmpeg-related forums found in the world wide web. If you would like to see your forum added here, please send an email to the ffmpeg-devel mailing list.

Also if you don't receive a reply on the forums, try our official mailing list or IRC channels. And most importantly, if you see questions from others on the forums or mailing list that you know the answer to, please help and reply. The forums are largely community supported and few official developers read them regularly.
