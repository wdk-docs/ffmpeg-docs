<h2>October 30th, 2016, Results: Summer Of Code 2016.<a class="headerlink" href="#october-30th-2016-results-summer-of-code-2016" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it’s just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here’s the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:</p>
<p>FFv1 (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)
Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav’s work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.</p>
<p>Self test coverage (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)
Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.</p>
<p>MPEG-4 ALS encoder implementation (Mentor: Thilo Borgmann)
Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair’s work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.</p>
<p>Tee muxer improvements (Mentor: Marton Balint)
Ján Sebechlebský’s generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.</p>
<p>TrueHD encoder (Mentor: Rostislav Pehlivanov)
Jai Luthra’s objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai’s code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder’s speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>Motion interpolation filter (Mentor: Paul B Mahol)
Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There’s still work to be done to call these filters ‘finished’, which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.</p>
<p>And that’s it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!</p>
<p>September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.
Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output devices have been updated to support SDL2.</p>

<p>After thorough deliberation, we’re announcing that we’re about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release. ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax. Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.</p>

<h2>January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders<a class="headerlink" href="#january-30-2016-removing-support-for-two-external-aac-encoders" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and libaacplus in FFmpeg master.</p>
<p>Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as stable, it was known that libvo-aacenc was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples. However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option in our code base.</p>
<p>When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.</p>
<p>The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition to the native encoder (aac) when updating to the next version of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC (libfdk_aac) with an appropriate profile option to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing headaches.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!
After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.</p>
<p>Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.</p>
<p>The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started during this year’s GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov. Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks to Kamedo2 who does comparisons and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide feedback or breakage reports through our bug tracker.</p>

<p>FFmpeg participated to the latest edition of the Google Summer of Code Project. FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned projects, and 7 of them were successful.</p>
<p>We want to thank Google, the participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this effort. We’re looking forward to participating in the next GSoC edition!</p>
<p>Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of each single project.</p>
<p>Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George
Stephan Holljes’s project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.</p>
<p>The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting a single client;
it was completed partly during the qualification period and partly during the first week of the summer.
Thanks to this work, it is now possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ffmpeg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">video0</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">listen</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">matroska</span> \

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept several clients,
simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not have an API for that kind of task,
it was necessary to design one. This part was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded content.</p>
<p>The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code review.</p>
<p>Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz Szczepańczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek
Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented Samba directory listing as qualification task.</p>
<p>During the program he extended the API with the possibility to remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP protocols.</p>
<p>At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an implementation for HTTP directory listening.</p>
<p>Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack
Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.</p>
<p>The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.</p>
<p>The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to finally figure out how to get DVB working.</p>
<p>Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale
Niklesh’s project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and is interesting because it’s usually the only subtitle format supported by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.</p>
<p>Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like bold/italics, highlighting, etc.</p>
<p>The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.</p>
<p>Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size information in the subtitles - and that’s no joke: the now infamous Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.</p>
<p>All of Niklesh’s work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.</p>
<p>libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla
Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers. To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps. The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were tried to avoid speed loss.</p>
<p>He also added gamma corrected scaling support. An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ffmpeg</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="nb">input</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">vf</span> <span class="n">scale</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">512</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">384</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">gamma</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">output</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available, and he is a FFmpeg committer now.
He continues to contribute to FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has ended.</p>
<p>AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire
Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main prediction on the native AAC encoder.
Of all those extensions, only TNS was left in a less-than-usable state,
but the implementation has been pushed (disabled) anyway since it’s a good basis for further improvements.</p>
<p>PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a simple feature.</p>
<p>TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy bands).</p>
<p>Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as effective on classic X-Y recordings though.</p>
<p>Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC, and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for further improvements to make.</p>
<p>In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times, something he’s also working to fix.</p>
<p>Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol
Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the qualification task.
Later he wrote interframe compression via various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.</p>
<p>Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.</p>
<p>During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the decoder due to the fact that it doesn’t match APNG specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the PNG decoder has been fixed.</p>
<p>For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder, making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.</p>

<p>Dear multimedia community,</p>
<p>The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has come by surprise.
He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many years and we must thank him for the work that he has done.
We hope that in the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming weeks,
the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.</p>
<p>The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both contributors and users.
We should now look to the future, try to find solutions to these issues,
and to have reconciliation between the forks, which have split the community for so long.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate venues so far,
which has made finding common ground and solutions difficult.
We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming weeks,
and in person at the VideoLAN Developer Days in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source multimedia community.</p>
<p>The FFmpeg project.</p>

<p>We happily announce that FFmpeg will be represented at Chemnitzer Linux-Tage (CLT) in Chemnitz, Germany. The event will take place on 21st and 22nd of March.</p>
<p>More information can be found here</p>
<p>We demonstrate usage of FFmpeg, answer your questions and listen to your problems and wishes. If you have media files that cannot be processed correctly with FFmpeg, be sure to have a sample with you so we can have a look!</p>
<p>For the first time in our CLT history, there will be an FFmpeg workshop! You can read the details here. The workshop is targeted at FFmpeg beginners. First the basics of multimedia will be covered. Thereafter you will learn how to use that knowledge and the FFmpeg CLI tools to analyse and process media files. The workshop is in German language only and prior registration is necessary. The workshop will be on Saturday starting at 10 o’clock.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to meet you (again)!</p>

<p>We wanted you to know there are FFmpeg packages in Debian unstable again. A big thank-you to Andreas Cadhalpun and all the people that made it possible. It has been anything but simple.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that was already the easy part of this news. The bad news is the packages probably won’t migrate to Debian testing to be in the upcoming release codenamed jessie. Read the argumentation over at Debian.</p>
<p>However things will come out in the end, we hope for your continued remarkable support!</p>

<p>Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group), FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 “Outreach Program for Women” intern to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014 (through March 2015).</p>
<p>We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you to Samsung and the OPW program committee!</p>
<p>If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take a look at our OPW wiki page for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the OPW program, please get in touch with us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:opw&#37;&#52;&#48;ffmpeg&#46;org">opw<span>&#64;</span>ffmpeg<span>&#46;</span>org</a>. With your help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!</p>

<p>Following our previous post regarding our participation on this year’s OPW (Outreach Program for Women), we are now reaching out to our users (both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to secure our spot in the program.
We need to put together 6K USD as a minimum but securing more funds would help us towards getting more than one intern.
You can donate by credit card using Click&amp;Pledge and selecting the “OPW” option. If you would like to donate by money transfer or by check, please get in touch by e-mail and we will get back to you with instructions.

<p>FFmpeg has started the process to become an OPW includer organization for the next round of the program, with internships starting December 9. The OPW aims to “Help women (cis and trans) and genderqueer to get involved in free and open source software”. Part of the process requires securing funds to support at least one internship (6K USD), so if you were holding on your donation to FFmpeg, this is a great chance for you to come forward, get in touch and help both the project and a great initiative!</p>
<p>We have set up an email address you can use to contact us about donations and general inquires regarding our participation in the program. Hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline and has been replaced and all software reinstalled. FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago. That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.</p>
<p>We recommend all users to change their passwords. Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</p>
